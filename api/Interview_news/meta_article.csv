Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

1. Everything you need to know about career coaching ↑

Okay, first let's answer the main questions you're likely to have about career coaching: how it works, is it worth it, what are the prices, etc.

Feel free to skip straight to the shortlist of best career coaching services.

1.1 What is a career coach? 

A career coach is a coaching expert who can help you with your career decisions and development, no matter where you are in your career.

Unlike a resume coach or interview coach, a career coach doesn’t just focus on one aspect of the job application process; a good one will help you gain clarity and confidence about your overall career path, helping you come up with an actionable plan to reach your goals. 

1.2. How much does a career coach cost?

A career coach can cost from $50 to $250 per hour, $20 to $1500 per month, $95 to $3500 per package, or 5% to 9% of your first annual income, depending on the kind and range of services offered and the experience and skill of the coaches.

We've analyzed the prices across close to 20 major career coaching websites. You’ll see that their starting prices vary widely, with some offering to disclose only on a consultation call.

1.3. Is career coaching really worth it?

Not always. Hiring a career coach is a significant investment. Only you can decide if it’s worth it, depending on your specific situation and the challenges you’re facing in your career.

Let's take a look at some examples in which hiring a career coach can definitely help.

1.3.1 You're considering a career change/transition

If you’re confused about whether you’re in the right career or if you’ve been actively considering a career change, hiring a career coach would greatly enlighten your decision-making process. 

For example, you’re considering switching to a new industry, such as tech. Choose a tech career coach who has worked in that industry or who has made a similar transition to the one you’re planning. They will have a very clear idea of what you need to do and outline challenges you can expect.

Check out our lists of the best tech career coaching services and the best career transition coaching services.

1.3.2 You're having difficulty landing a job

Most career coaches also work as resume and interview coaches, so they can help you at every stage of your job search; from picking what jobs to apply for to getting the offer.

This is particularly beneficial if your coach has extensive experience in your specific industry (such as finance, sales, consulting, tech, etc.), as they can give you deep insights into what's required and how to make yourself a stronger candidate.

1.3.3 You're facing challenges at work

If you're feeling stuck, navigating a complex problem, or having trouble adjusting to a new role, a career coach could help you get to the bottom of your troubles and guide you through finding a workable solution. 

A coach with experience working in your specific role is likely to have encountered the same issues and challenges you’re facing. Therefore, they should be able to give you highly relevant and actionable advice.

1.3.4 You're seeking to level up your career

Got specific goals to level up your career but not sure how or where to begin? A career coach can help you gain clarity and confidence in your career decisions. You can discuss how to boost your qualifications for a promotion, come up with a good strategy for negotiating a raise, or create an action plan to prepare for a leadership role.

1.3.5 You want to improve specific skills

Imagine you’re an engineer who needs to boost your people management skills or a product manager who needs to boost your analytical skills. A career coach with experience in your industry could help you create an improvement plan that’s best suited to your situation and current skill set, whether that’s doing regular practice and feedback sessions with them or using additional courses or training.

If you want a long-term arrangement, mentoring might be the right option—see our list of the best mentoring services.

1.4. Benefits of getting a career coach

Why do you need to pay for career advice from a professional coach when your work mentor or friend could give it out for free? Well, here are a few reasons:

1.4.1 A professional career coach is free from bias

Colleagues and friends will generally shy away from pointing out your weaknesses and may often tell you what they think you want to hear. Plus, the advice they give you may be highly subjective.

In contrast, a career coach will be objective about your career needs. They should quickly be able to identify where you need to improve and they are used to giving honest advice, constructively.

1.4.2 A career coach can hold you accountable to your goals 

If sticking to goals and commitments is something that you struggle with, a career coach will help you work your way through it. 

Together, you and your coach should develop a strategy that includes setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals and a structure for regular check-ins and celebrating milestones. 

1.4.3 A career coach has a broader knowledge of the job market

With the job market in recent years in a state of “transformation and turbulence,” having a coach who has a broader knowledge of what’s going on in your industry can be a way of gleaning high-level insights to help you adapt to trends and market forces. They can guide you through making the right career decisions, based on your values, goals, and current situation.

From onboarding employees to developing them to helping them transition out of the organization, Intoo takes what it calls a “whole-human career coaching approach” for every phase of the employee lifecycle.

Its main services include career development coaching, executive coaching, and outplacement coaching.

Career development coaching includes training and workshops with practical exercises and interactive breakouts to encourage fresh insights and increased work motivation.

Executive coaching recognizes that no two executives are the same, so it covers exploring leadership style, managing strategic priorities, anticipating and leading through change, and engaging diverse talent.

Unlike other outplacement coaching services with set time limits, Intoo has none. Coaches recognize that transitions impact each person’s life and well-being, so they focus on understanding each individual candidate’s goals and work with them to develop a personalized path to transition success.

Intoo is a career development and outplacement flagship of Gi Group Holdings, with 26 years of experience and more than 25,000 companies served.

If you’re just seeking a quick session to answer a few job-related questions, a 30-minute career Q&A with a Mentor is your most cost-effective option. This option includes a call and a follow-up plan from your coach. 

While the 30-minute Q&A may work for some people, if you’re looking for a more thorough coaching service, this might not work for you, and you may have to get their more in-depth (meaning: pricier) services.

Pricing:  $56 to $275 for a 30-minute career Q&A

If you’re looking for a long-term career mentor, we've heard good things about MentorCruise. They offer a range of long-term mentoring packages, ranging from $40-$500 per month. Other more experienced mentors will charge a bit higher, as well as those from more prestigious companies.

Not all mentors will offer the same package. Some mentors will offer 3 x 45-minute calls per month, while others will provide 4 or more. 

While this type of structure might work for some people, paying for and committing to a whole month of mentorship might be a little too expensive for others. 

MentorCruise does offer a 20-minute introductory call for $39, so you can get that if you’re not sure whether a long-term career mentoring program is right for you. They also have a 7-day free trial to help you assess whether a specific mentor is a good match.

Find out more about MentorCruise and alternatives.

CloseCohen’s principal coach, Alisa Cohen, has 20+ years of coaching experience and has held impressive leadership positions at big corporations like Starbucks and Amazon. It’s not clear whether the company has other coaches or if Cohen is the only coach you’ll be able to work with. 

Unlike on IGotAnOffer, their website does not readily provide the rates, so you’ll have to book an intake call to get a figure.

Pricing: Rates disclosed during intake call
Reviews: 4.7 stars on Yelp
Coaching expertise: Principal coach Alisa Cohen has 20+ years of coaching experience

Pathrise offers 1-on-1 job application mentoring for candidates in software engineering, product management, strategy, operations, data, marketing, and sales. Its mentors have worked at top companies such as Microsoft, Apple, LinkedIn, and successful startups like GitHub. 

Unlike on most career coaching websites, you don’t get to choose your mentors–the ones you get will depend on the industry track you choose.

What makes Pathrise unique is that candidates are only required to pay once they’ve landed the job they’re aiming for upon joining the program. The actual fees are not available on the website, but some reviews estimate the program cost to be 5% to 9% of your first annual income. 

Pathrise offers two income-based repayment options.

Upon applying to the program, you can try their service for 2 weeks on a free trial. If you plan to continue with their service, you’ll have to commit to a 12-month program. 

Understandably, the 12-month commitment might be a bit too much for some. You can opt to cancel early on after the free trial, but that could incur a fee. If you don’t land a job within 12 months, your fee is waived. 

Find out more about Pathrise and alternatives.

The Hired Group was founded and run by career coach Ryan Kahn, one of LinkedIn’s “Top Executive Coaches” and an expert coach featured in the 20-episode MTV docuseries HIRED! It offers job search strategy, resume and LinkedIn review, and interview preparation services with Kahn himself.

Since sessions are subject to Kahn’s availability and rates are not published, it can be surmised that prices might be pretty steep. This might be less suitable for professionals outside the executive or board-level roles.

Frequently asked questions about career coaching↑
1. How important is career coaching in career development?

If you want to take a proactive approach to your career development, career coaching can give you a leg up in the long run.

Instead of simply following traditional career trajectories, you can make informed decisions about your career with the guidance of a career coach. A career coach will help you clarify what it is you want out of your career, and from there the two of you can work together on the best plan of action for you to achieve your goals, both short-term and long-term. 

2. What is the difference between a life coach and a career coach?

A life coach may touch on certain aspects of your professional life as it pertains to work-life balance, life goals, and mental health. But if you’re specifically looking for a coach to help you navigate a promotion, plan a career path, solve specific work-related issues, or improve your chances of landing a desired position, then you would need a career coach. 

3. Where can I find the best career coach?

The best career coach is not one-size-fits-all. Getting the best coach for you depends on your own professional needs, preferences, time, and budget. 

What qualities should you look out for when deciding on the best career coach for you? 

3.1. Years of experience in your field or within the area of recruitment

Someone who has been in a professional situation similar to yours: a coach who’s successfully transitioned to a role that you’re considering, a senior leader in your industry, or a startup founder in your field of interest. You can learn not just from their successes but from their mistakes and missteps as well.

3.2. Extensive experience working as a coaching 

Ask for references or case studies demonstrating a coach's success stories.

3.3. Excellent communication skills 

If you have an initial call with them, observe if a coach has the ability to voice their ideas clearly and give feedback in a constructive and supportive manner

Reading reviews from previous clients is a good way to learn more about career coaches and whether their expertise and approach fit your needs. "

1. Top 7 tips on writing a software engineer resume to get into FAANG↑

We asked Cody (top tech recruiter, ex-Google now at LinkedIn) and Candace (career and resume expert) what advice they'd give to a software engineer writing a resume to get into FAANG/MAANG or similar.

They've helped a LOT of people get into top tech companies and they evaluate SWE resumes every day, so they know what they're talking about. This is what they came up with:

1.1 Answer recruiters' questions immediately

There is one thing that all recruiters and hiring managers want to know immediately: years of role-relevant experience. 

And if you're applying for an engineering leadership role, they'll also want to see how many years of management experience you have.

So, make it easy for them.

""Us recruiters are lazy. Don't make us dig around for the key info, we want to see if you meet the job requirements in the first 10 seconds!"" says Cody.

To do this, you could include some bullet points with this key information at the top of your SWE resume. This leads us to the next point.

1.2 Consider a non-traditional structure

The layout we recommend in Section 4 is the traditional one, perhaps the safest. But it's not obligatory. 

Cody prefers using two bullet-point summaries at the top of your resume to pack in the key information and your most impressive career achievements as a software engineer.

""The top of the resume is the prime real estate. Put the shiny bits, your best achievements, up top. That way you've got a better chance of grabbing the recruiter's attention.""

This is what it looks like on page 1 of his resume.

Click to watch Cody's full explanation of this non-traditional resume format.

1.3 Avoid using design features

There really is no upside to using a fancy resume design. It won't impress recruiters and, in a worst-case scenario, could actually prevent your resume from being properly processed.

""Design features like pictures, columns, photos, etc. can prevent ATS systems from correctly scanning your resume,"" says Candace.

You should also avoid including your photo in your resume, as this goes against employment and discrimination laws in most countries, and is another potential problem for applicant tracking systems (ATS).

1.4 Be explicit about the locations you’re open to working at / remote

So many people fail to do this. But if FAANG recruiters are going to approach you for software engineer roles, rather than the other way around, they'll need to know the locations you're available to work at.

If you're willing to relocate for the right SWE role, make that clear in your resume. Instead of putting ""San Francisco"" under your name next to your email, maybe you put ""Locations: San Francisco| Remote| Hybrid within a 30-mile radius of Bay Area"".

1.5 Cut out all waffle

Recruiters like Cody and Candace see so many personal statements or 'objective' sections at the top of resumes which take up valuable space without saying much at all.

""Everything on your resume needs to be specific,” says Cody. ""Putting ‘Experienced engineer passionate about making great products"" doesn't tell me anything. It wastes both space and seconds of the recruiter's time. You've got to be more specific. How many years of experience? What great products have you made?""

1.6 Numbers tell a better story

This is worth repeating again and again: quantify your achievements. All the most effective resumes are packed full of metrics and numbers that put achievements in context.

""Especially in engineering but honestly this advice is for many careers spanning many industries, we have to tell our story through data and numbers. Words can tell a story but numbers tell it way better,"" says Cody.

So, if you’ve successfully worked on an app update, include the specific metrics by which you measured its success (increased daily active users, downloads, engagement). If you’ve led a software redesign, how much money were you able to save the company with it? Without numbers, your achievements are hard to evaluate.

1.7 Use a skills section to include keywords for your role

You don't want to jam your resume full of keywords, but with ATS increasingly used, it is important to make sure your resume mentions the necessary skills, tools, and technologies. Candace says that a skills section can be a great place to list all these very efficiently.

""A ‘Skills’ section can help recruiters quickly see if you fit their requirements, and is also a great way to get keywords into your resume. You could also consider a ‘technology snapshot’ type section if the jobs you’re applying for require experience in specific technologies.""

2. Key skills for your software engineer resume↑

There are some key skills that are important in any software engineer resume, and we're not just talking about the obvious technical skills.

2.1 Leadership skills, even if you're not applying for a leadership role 

Recruiters and hiring managers want to see that you have what it takes to become a leader if you're not one already. So include examples where you led a project, took the initiative, or influenced other people.

If you haven’t got many strong examples from your work experience, try to find examples from personal projects or university (if recently graduated).

If you're applying to a management role, include experience working with cross-functional teams and aligning various stakeholders.

2.2 Coding languages

Obviously. Google recommends listing these right at the start.

2.3 Problem-solving skills 

As a software engineer, an important part of your job is to come up with innovative solutions to problems. So you’ll want to highlight that you’ve got the skills in this department on your resume. 

Give examples of problems you’ve solved in your previous role, whether it’s a workflow or deployment issue, debugging, etc. You can also include examples from personal projects.

2.4 System design skills 

These are needed for engineering roles at top tech companies. You'll need to be able to discuss engineering architecture and make decisions relating to efficiency, scalability, and performance. 

So if you have any experience in designing systems, or related experience, make sure it’s prominent on your resume.

2.5 Domain knowledge

Recruiters want to get a sense of your knowledge across different areas and technologies.

If you don't have much work experience yet, include personal projects as a way to demonstrate domain knowledge.

Right, let's see some example resumes.

3. 9 SWE resume examples that worked for Google, Amazon, etc.↑

Before we start guiding you on how to write your software engineer resume step-by-step, take a look at some real examples that got their owners interviews at the very top companies.

You'll notice they follow different formats, and none fully follow the guidelines we set out below. We think this shows two things:

There are many acceptable ways to write a resume
Your resume doesn't have to be perfect, as long as it demonstrates your skills and achievements effectively.

Let's take a look

3.1 Google software engineer resume example (fresher)

This is a great example of a strong fresher software engineer resume. It got ""Ana"" interviews at Google despite having almost no professional experience.

Here's what Ana does well on this resume:

Education first: Ana doesn't have much work experience so she starts with Education, detailing specific topics in both her undergraduate and Masters courses.
Projects: As a fresher candidate, Ana does well to list some relevant Projects to fill the gap where more experienced candidates would list recent employment.
3.2 Amazon senior software development engineer resume example

The candidate, let's call him ""Sunil"", got interviews for a Senior Software Development Engineer role at Amazon with this resume.

Here's our feedback on this resume:

Experience: We had to blank them out, but Sunil had worked for some really top tech companies. This is what makes the resume really strong.
Quantifying impact: Sunil could perhaps enhance his resume by better quantifying his actions and demonstrating their impact. For example, he says he ""Revised Telemetry dashboards to improve signal-noise ratio"". How much did he improve it? Including specific metrics more often would take this resume to the next level.
Key skills: Sunil lists key skills and tools that were likely listed as requirements in the job description. This makes a recruiter's life easier.
3.3 Google software engineer resume example (front-end developer)

The resume below is from ""Lana"". It got her interviews for a front-end developer role at Google.

Here's our feedback on this resume:
Skills: Lana lists her relevant hard skills in a way that's very easy for a recruiter to understand at a glance.
Languages: Don't make the mistake of thinking languages aren't relevant for a technical job. Lana's five languages signal that she's a strong communicator and helped her get an interview.
Impact: Lana doesn't include examples of impact and results that she's achieved at work. Doing so would have greatly improved this resume.
3.4 Crunchyroll software engineer resume example (Android developer)

This resume got ""Sam"" interviews at CrunchyRoll for a senior Android developer position.

 

Here's what we liked about Sam's resume:

Structure: Sam lists his technical skills, including programming languages, at the top.
Impact: His work achievements are mostly well-quantified, e.g. 'increasing... downloads by 80% in 2 months.""
Action verbs: He always starts the bullet point with powerful action verbs such as ""Created"", ""Designed"", ""Fixed"", etc.
3.5 Audible software engineer resume example (iOS)

The below resume belongs to ""Jerry"", an iOS engineer who at the time of writing was interviewing at Audible.

Here’s our feedback on Jerry’s resume:

Structure: Jerry lists all coding languages, tools, frameworks, and certifications in a separate section. The easy-to-read format catches the eye.
Impact: The resume starts with a quick description of his highest educational attainment (master’s degree) and his biggest achievement to date.
3.6 Dropbox software engineer resume example (full-stack) 
Here’s the resume that got “Casey” a full-stack software engineer role at Dropbox.

 Here are a few details that make Casey’s resume stand out:

Structure: Casey starts off her resume with a whole bullet point section for her core qualifications. At the side, she has a well-organized skills section detailing her languages, framework, and tools.
Detailed but easy to read: Casey’s descriptions of her professional experiences are highly detailed, but they’s easy to read and digest. One reason is that that she uses action verbs and she makes sure to include achievements that are quantifiable.
Advocacy: In her latest role, she includes successfully spearheading a group with an advocacy that’s close to her heart. This shows not just her effective leadership but also that she is someone who aims to positively impact the company culture.
3.7 Amazon software development engineer resume example 
“Sanju” is currently a software development engineer who’s made a successful internal move at Amazon. Here’s his current resume:
Structure: Sanju resume has a clear and easy-to-read structure.
Quantified impact: His roles and even his extracurricular achievements include numbers that indicate his success.
Academic achievements: He makes sure to include his projects, publications, and certifications. They show that he’s always keen to learn and broaden his knowledge and expertise.  
3.8 Director of engineering resume example 
If you’re applying for an engineering leadership position, check out “Larry’s” 2-page resume as a senior director of engineering.

Apart from his extensive professional experience, here are some of the things that make Larry’s resume outstanding:

Career highlights: Aside from listing his core competencies, Larry dedicates a section to his career highlights, quantifying his achievements where necessary.
Relevant information only: Larry keeps his resume to 2 pages by choosing to go detailed only in his most recent leadership roles. But he does have a short section on his early career, an impressive technical toolkit list, and a mention of a US patent.
Colleague testimonial: The testimonial is a nice touch. It shows Larry has a good working relationship with former colleagues, something a recruiter will want to know if they’re hiring for a leadership role.
3.9 Google software engineer resume example
Sahand is currently a senior software engineer at Google. He entered the company as an L3 and got promoted internally to L5.
Here's our feedback on Sahand's resume:
Clear and concise: The first thing you’ll notice about Sahand's resume is it has plenty of negative space. It’s easy on the eyes, but still packed with relevant information.
Action-oriented: Each bullet point starts with an action verb, showing what he was able to achieve with each role. We do think it could be further improved with metrics, though as it is, it’s pretty impressive.
3.10  Amazon engineering manager resume example
This is the resume that got “Sarah” an engineering manager role at Amazon. She also got calls from Meta and Google with the same resume.

We think what made Sarah’s resume stand out is that it was highly focused on leadership. 

Diversity of leadership experience: She made sure to highlight the roles in which she acted as a leader in an official capacity. She included the methodologies that she used, her domain expertise, and her breadth of experience in various industries.
Extracurricular leadership: She also included ventures outside her role which further highlighted her leadership, including her various certifications and the extracurricular initiatives she led.
3.11 Amazon senior software development engineer resume example (machine learning) 
“Vikash” is currently an adjunct lecturer and a senior machine learning software engineer at Amazon Ads, and here’s his current resume.

Now that you've seen some good example resumes, let's look at how you should create yours.

4. Software engineer (SWE) resume template↑

Unlike the examples listed above, this is not a real resume. Instead, it's an amalgamation of the many high-quality SWE/SDE resumes that candidates have shared with us before going on to work at Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.

It belongs to an imaginary mid-level software engineer called Karl, but it can be applied to any role level.

Now, let’s take the first step in building a software engineer resume that's good enough to get into FAANG/MAANG.

5. How to write a software engineer resume (section-by-section)↑

Now that you’ve seen what you should be aiming for with the SWE resume examples we’ve shown, as well as some key tips, let’s go through the resume-building process, step-by-step.

Step 1: Study the target company and job description

Before you start writing or editing your resume, our tip is that you do some research.

Find the job specification, read it thoroughly, and use it to shape your resume in the following ways:

What type of SWE profile the job description is looking for. Which skills will be most crucial for the role? What are the keywords it's looking for and does your resume contain them in a way that makes sense? Prepare to adapt your resume’s content accordingly.
Zoom in on a few of the most important responsibilities. Search for specific examples from your past that demonstrate experience in doing the same thing or something very similar. Find the numbers to back it up where possible, so you’re ready to include this information in the work experience section later on.
Take note of the language. Try to match the specific verbs and phrases used in the job description where appropriate, 
Research the company. For example, imagine you’re targeting an SWE role at Meta. Meta has 5 core values, so you’d want to make sure that your resume transmits these values too. That might mean including a volunteering activity under Interests to show that you like to ""build social value.""  Do the same if you’re applying to Google, Amazon, etc.

Does all this mean you’ll need a different iteration of your resume for every tech job you target? Ideally yes, but there will be a lot of overlap, so usually you’ll only need to make a few strategic edits.

Once you’ve done the research, you’ll be ready to start writing.

Step 2: Choose a layout

The design of your resume should have one objective: to convey all the relevant information in a way that is clear, easy to digest, and professional. Use our sample resume as your template, and you’ve already achieved that!

Some people add a second objective: to demonstrate strong design skills in order to stand out from the crowd and impress the recruiter.

However, we recommend treading carefully with this. Recruiters for large companies are unlikely to be impressed by a resume’s design. They’re interested in the content. Some might even be put off by a “creative” or unique design. To avoid this risk, aim to stand out through your resume’s content, not its design.

Keep it clean and simple. And as we’ve noted above, you should avoid including your photo in your resume. This goes against employment and discrimination laws in most countries and is another potential problem for ATS.

Step 3: Choose your sections

There are lots of ways to write a software engineer resume. It’s entirely up to you which exact sections you want to include. We recommend using the following sections for an SWE resume because we know this approach works for companies such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, for both junior and experienced candidates.

Personal information
Work experience
Education
Awards and leadership
Additional skills and interests

You may want to tweak the order. For example, if you’ve just graduated or have just a year or two of experience, Google recommends starting with your education section.

Step 4: Start writing

The good news is, you don’t have to get it perfect the first time. A strong resume is usually one that is re-written and tweaked multiple times.

We’ve spoken to tech recruiters to get guidance on how to write up each section. Let’s take a look.

Personal information section

This section is not the place to try and impress. Just make sure you get your key details across as concisely as possible.

DO

Use a bigger font for your name than for the rest of the section to make it stand out
Include your name, email address, phone number, city/county you live in, any relocation information or remote work preference
Ideally, include a link to your LinkedIn profile (or GitHub if you have an engineering background)

DON’T

Title this section. It’s not necessary, so save the space
Include a street address - it’s unnecessary and unsafe
Include a photo, date of birth, or gender, unless specifically requested to do so
Label each piece of information e.g. “email:”, “tel:”, etc. It’s obvious what they are, so save the space
Work experience section

This is probably the most important part of your resume to get right, and the easiest to get wrong. Many candidates think that their work experience speaks for itself, and simply list their roles and a few of their main responsibilities.

This may work in some cases, but we recommend a much more powerful approach.

Instead of listing responsibilities, you need to talk about actions. This means starting each bullet point with an action verb. 

These verbs should relate to the key skills from Section 2 that companies look for in SWE resumes: ""Executed,"" ""Unblocked,"" ""Led,"" and ""Delivered"" are some good examples of such verbs.

Choosing actions that are relevant to the essential tech skills will help you ensure that your resume contains the keywords that recruiters (and sometimes ATS) will be looking for.

You should also focus on the results of what you did and quantify them as much as possible to highlight the tangible contributions you have made. Ex-Google SVP Lazlo Bock talks about a common method for doing this that you might find helpful, called the “X, Y, Z” formula:

“Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]”.

For example, “Decreased server response time by 30% by implementing machine learning implementation”.

Following the X,Y, Z formula is a simple way to make sure you are as specific as possible about your work achievements and quantify them where possible. Let's take a look at some examples:

""Reduced AWS spending by 15% by designed and implemented resource scaling policies to optimize cloud infrastructure.""
""Improved code quality (40% decrease in post-release bugs Y-on-Y) by implementing a more structured code review system.""
""Reduced server downtime, resulting in 99% server uptime, by deploying automated monitoring tools and establishing proactive alerting system.""

Another format that working engineers recommend on Reddit is the CAR method which stands for Challenge - Action - Result. According to this article, the CAR method is a good format to use if you want to bring focus to the challenges you’ve conquered in your career thus far. 

You can use the CAR method when looking back on the career highlights that you want to include in your resume, like this:

Challenge: The application’s load times were significantly impacting user experience and customer satisfaction.
Action: Analyzed bottlenecks in the codebase and implemented caching strategies, optimized database queries.
Result: Reduced page load time by 40%, leading to a 20% increase in user retention and a 15% boost in overall app engagement.

And then you can summarize this information as such:

“Improved system performance by identifying code bottlenecks and implementing caching strategies and optimizing database queries resulting in a 40% reduction in page load time, a 20% increase in user retention, and a 15% boost in app engagement.""

Don't feel that all your bullet points have to follow the exact X,Y,Z or CAR formula. Both are just really useful mechanisms for making sure you give clear, specific, and quantifiable examples of your impact and the challenges you’ve worked on in your career.

Here are a few more do’s and don’ts:

DO

Use reverse chronological order, putting most recent employment at the top
Use present tense verbs (e.g. ""Lead, Coordinate, Execute"") in your current position (except for completed achievements), and past tense verbs for past positions  and completed achievements (e.g. ""Led, Coordinated, Executed"")
If you're an engineer, consider including the programming language you used for each project (Google's recommendation)
Describe your actions and what they achieved
Include metrics to quantify what your actions achieved where possible
Study the language of the job description and where appropriate, match it
Make sure you’ve naturally included several relevant keywords
Demonstrate a balance of skills

DON’T

Be shy and humble. Now is not the time!
Just put your responsibilities
Be vague
Go so overboard with numbers that it looks like a math problem. It still needs to be easy to read
Include lots of buzzwords just for the sake of it
Education section

This section should be extremely concise and clear. Hopefully, your educational achievements can do the talking for you, as all you can really do here is present the necessary information with the right level of detail.

Note that if you have recently graduated and only have internship experiences instead of relevant work experience, this section should follow the Personal Information section. You may also want to go into a bit more detail. Otherwise, you can include it after work experience.

Follow the tips below to make sure you get it just right.

DO

If you have multiple degrees, you should start your list with your highest level of education first (e.g. your master's degree/PhD)
For each degree, include the name of the degree, university, and dates in the headline
List your grades (e.g. GPA) as well as results of other standardized tests you have taken (e.g. SAT, GMAT, etc.) that demonstrate your intellect
Detail any awards and scholarships you received at the university level and most importantly how competitive they were (e.g. 2 awards for 1,000 students)
Include tech bootcamps (e.g. General Assembly) and link to your projects on GitHub or any online courses you may have taken (e.g. Udacity) if you don’t have much work experience 

DON’T

Panic if you don't have a degree. You don’t have to have gone to college to get into a FAANG/MAANG company. Instead, put your high school grades and any relevant educational qualifications you gained after school
Include high school experience if you've already graduated
Include your thesis / dissertation unless you're a fairly recent graduate, in which case you should summarize the topic in a way that's VERY easy to understand
Awards & Leadership section

We've labelled this section ""Awards & Leadership"" instead of ""Extracurricular"" section for two reasons:

Google uses it as its recommended resume template (see here)
Extracurricular activities are less important for a technical role like a software engineer

The more experience you have, the easier it should be for you to find two or three strong bullet points that demonstrate leadership (outside your day-to-day work) or awards.

If you haven't won any awards or can't think of any strong leadership examples outside your day-to-day role, then consider leaving this section out entirely.

DO

Put awards in context, e.g. ""1st out of 22 applicants""
Consider leaving this section out if you're lacking content

DON'T

Use awards from school or university if you graduated more than ten years ago
Include weaker achievements (e.g ""employee of the week"") just to fill space
Additional skills and interests section

With a software engineer resume, you need to show that you're adept at using a wide range of tools, methodologies, and technologies. Listing them here can make it easy for a recruiter to quickly check you meet their requirements.

DO

If you need to save vertical space, list skills in sentences rather than bullets

DON’T

Include generic, uninteresting things that everyone likes doing, like “watching Netflix” or “hanging out with friends,” as interests
List basic skills that almost everyone has, such as ""Google Docs"" or ""MS Word""
Step 5: Proofread and get feedback

Don’t skip this step! Use a grammar-checking tool and then proofread until it’s perfect. This is harder than it sounds because multiple reviews and tweaking after the initial proofread can easily create new hard-to-spot errors. The only solution is to proofread again after each tweak.

One thing you’ll need to watch out for is the official spelling of the languages, tools, and frameworks under your skills section. For example, HTML5 and not Html5, SQL and not Sql, etc. Your skills section is an important part of your resume and offers a quick glance at your competency, so you don’t want to mess it up with inconsistent formats and wrong spellings.

We recommend saving your resume as a PDF unless the job description says otherwise. Make sure to check it opens properly (with the correct formatting) on a Mac or PC.

Receiving feedback is also important. Share it with a friend or partner, and they’ll be very likely to see mistakes that you haven’t noticed. Of course, if you can share it with an experienced SWE recruiter / interviewer, that can give you a big advantage over other applicants.

DO

Proofread from top to bottom and then read it in reverse to check spelling
If you’ve tweaked it, proofread again before sending
Check the file opens properly on Mac and PC
Get feedback on it before sending

DON’T

Send it with typos. Your resume reflects your attention to detail
Should I put my GitHub link in my resume?↑

As you’ll see in the real software engineer resume examples we’ve included in Section 3, some include their GitHub link while others do not. So it’s safe to say that you don’t necessarily need to include your GitHub link in your SWE resume to get an interview with a top tech company.

It’s up to you to decide whether your GitHub profile will add value to your application. You need to be objective about this, as with anything you decide to include in your resume.

If you have an old GitHub profile that you haven’t updated in a while, including it in your resume may work against you. It may show bad projects and bad coding practices which you might get judged on, even if they no longer reflect your current skill level.

That being said, having a GitHub profile signals that you’re passionate about the job. And if you’re a fresher or have less than five years of experience, having an active GitHub profile will help show and confirm that you indeed have the skills required. 

If you’re second-guessing whether you should put your GitHub profile on your resume, an alternative is to link to an open-source project that you’re most proud of. 

And if you want to know how to use GitHub to your benefit, check out this article on how to use GitHub to strengthen your resume.

If you’ve used all the tips in this article, then your resume should be in good condition and will give you a fighting chance of getting a job at a big tech company. To increase your chances, read our guide on how to get into big tech companies (FAANG+) for even more tips.

7. Is your SWE resume good enough for FAANG?↑

If you're going for one of the top SWE jobs, having a resume that's fine may not be enough. Getting your SWE resume from fine to outstanding usually requires feedback from someone who really knows their stuff--as in an ex-recruiter or manager at one of the top companies.

We know it's hard to get access to those types of people. That's why we've created a software engineer resume review service. It allows you to get immediate feedback on your resume from a top recruiter/coach of your choosing. Take a look!

1.1 What does a Google data engineer do?

As a Google data engineer, you will process and transform raw data into a usable format, which is then further analyzed by other teams. You will also cleanse, organize, and manipulate data using pipelines.

You will also have to collaborate with engineers, marketing teams, product managers, sales associates, etc. These collaborations will help you to identify customer behavior and enhance network structure optimization accordingly.

Google’s Cloud Platform spans many different verticals and has hundreds of services across App Dev, Data, Infra, ML, and Security. This means that they need a large number of technically experienced data engineers and other professionals for each vertical.

What qualifications and skills are required to be a Google data engineer?

An analysis of current Google Careers posts for data engineer roles shows that the common minimum requirements are:

Bachelor's degree or equivalent practical experience

3 years of experience coding in one or more programming languages
3 years of experience working with data infrastructure and data models by performing exploratory queries and scripts
3 years of experience designing data pipelines and dimensional data modeling for synch and asynch system integration and implementation using internal (e.g., Flume, etc.) and external stacks (DataFlow, Spark, etc.)

If you want to work as a Google data engineer, you need to have essential technical and soft skills.

Technical skills include good facility with programming languages such as Python, Scala, and C++, as well as deep knowledge of SQL, data structures and algorithms, data warehousing, data modelling, ETLs, Kafka and using Kafka with Hadoop, UNIX and GNY/Linux systems.

Soft skills emphasize good communication and collaboration skills, as well as innovativeness, adaptability, flexibility, and sound decision-making.

1.2 How much do Google data engineers make?

Based on Levels.fyi data,  data engineers’ total compensation at Google in the United States ranges from $169.2K per year for L3 to $358K per year for L6. The median compensation in a United States package is $268K. Google’s compensation packages typically involve base salary, stock, and bonuses. 

Here is the breakdown of Google’s compensation packages for different data engineer levels.

If you’re unsure what level you’re being considered for, ask your recruiter. Location and years of experience will also influence differences in salary. 

Ultimately, how you do in your interviews will help determine what you’ll be offered. That’s why hiring one of our ex-Google interview coaches can provide such a significant return on investment.

And remember, compensation packages are always negotiable, even at Google. So if you do get an offer, don’t be afraid to ask for more. Use this Google offer negotiation guide to help you. If you want to receive practical advice and ask more questions on how to actually negotiate, consider booking one of our salary negotiation coaches to get expert advice.

2. Google Data Engineer Interview Process and Timeline ↑

What’s the Google interview process and timeline for the data engineer role? It usually takes more than eight weeks and follows the steps below.

2.1 What steps to expect
Resume screen
Online assessment (in some cases)
Phone screens (1-2 interviews, 45-60 min each)
Onsite interviews (4-5 interviews, 45-60 min each)

Let’s take a look at each step in more detail.

2.1.1 Resume screen

First, recruiters will look at your resume and assess if your experience matches the open position. This is the most competitive step in the process, as millions of candidates do not make it past this stage.

If you’re looking for expert feedback on your resume, you can get input from our team of ex-FAANG recruiters, who will cover what achievements to focus on (or ignore), how to fine-tune your bullet points, and more.

If you do have a connection to someone at Google, it can be really helpful to get an employee referral to the internal recruiting team, as it may increase your chances of getting into the interview process. According to Glassdoor data, 8% of data engineer candidates who got interviews with Google were through employee referrals.

2.1.2 Online assessment (in some cases)

Some candidates will receive an invitation for an online test before moving on to the first-round calls. These are more common for internship and junior positions, but may appear in experienced positions as well.

The test will assess your technical skills, with questions similar to the ones you'll be asked in your interviews (e.g. SQL, data structures and algorithms). There may also be a data architecture or pipeline design question as well.

The questions are typically open-ended, requiring you to come up with and defend your own solutions. You’ll likely have a deadline by which you have to complete the assessment, but the test itself is not timed. 

2.1.3 Phone screens

The next step includes one or two calls with Google interviewers via Google Hangouts, which last 45-60 minutes each.

Other than ice-breaker questions like “tell me about yourself” or “why Google?”, these phone screens will focus exclusively on your technical skills.

You’ll typically be doing your coding using a shared Google Doc, where you’re unable to run the code or see any static analysis. While most candidates choose to code in Python, you may use a coding language of your choice.

2.1.4 Onsite interviews

Your last hurdle in the Google data engineer interview process is the final onsite or virtual interview loop. This will include four to five separate rounds, which last 45-60 minutes each, and will cover the following topics:

SQL questions
Data management questions
Coding questions (e.g. data structures and algorithms)
Behavioral questions

We’ll be getting into greater detail on each of these types of questions, including examples, in Section 3.

The interviews will be one-on-ones with a mix of people from the team you’re applying to join, including data engineers, software engineers, hiring managers, etc. If you are physically onsite, one of the interviews will take the form of a less formal lunch interview with a future peer.

For your technical interviews (coding, SQL, data), you’ll either be working on a shared Google Doc with your interviewer, or drawing out systems and scripts on a whiteboard. We recommend you practice using these materials at home before going in for the interviews.

2.2 What exactly is Google looking for?

At the end of each interview, including the initial phone screens, each interviewer will grade your performance using a standardized feedback form. 

That form is constantly evolving, but we have listed the main components we know of at the time of writing this article below.

A) Questions asked

In the first section of the form, the interviewer fills in the questions they asked you. Future interviewers will take a look at this to make sure that you don't get asked the same questions twice.

B) Attribute scoring

Each interviewer will also assess you on the four main attributes Google looks for when hiring:

General cognitive ability (GCA). The company wants to hire smart engineers who can learn and adapt to new situations. Here your interviewer will try to understand how you solve hard problems and how you learn. For more information, take a look at our guide to the GCA interview.
Role-related knowledge and experience (RRK). The company wants to make sure that you have the right experience, domain expertise and competencies for the position you're applying for. For more information, take a look at our guide to the RRK interview.
Leadership. Google looks for a particular type of leadership called “emergent leadership.” You'll typically be working in cross-functional teams at Google, and different team members are expected to step up and lead at different times in the lifecycle of a project. For more information, check out our Googleyness and leadership interview guide.
Googleyness. The company wants to make sure Google is the right environment for you. Your interviewer will check whether you naturally exhibit the company's values including: being comfortable with ambiguity, having a bias to action, and having a collaborative nature. For more information, read our Googleyness and leadership interview guide.

Depending on the exact job you're applying for, these attributes might be broken down further. But the total number of attributes does not usually exceed six or seven.

In this middle section, Google's interviewers typically document your answers to each question in detail, and give you a score for each of the attributes above (e.g. ""Poor,"" ""Mixed,"" ""Good,"" ""Excellent"").

C) Final recommendation

Finally, interviewers will write a summary of your performance and provide an overall recommendation on whether they think Google should be hiring you or not (e.g. ""Strong no hire,"" ""No hire,"" ""Leaning no hire,"" ""Leaning hire,"" ""Hire,"" ""Strong hire"").

2.3 What happens behind the scenes

If things go well at your onsite interviews, here is what the final steps of the process look like:

1. Interviewers submit feedback

After your onsite, your interviewers will all submit their feedback usually within two to three days. This feedback is then passed on to the hiring committee.

2. Hiring committee recommendation

The hiring committee will review the interviewers’ feedback, along with your resume, internal referrals, and any past work you have submitted. At this stage, the hiring committee will make a recommendation on whether Google should hire you or not.

3. Team-matching

If the hiring committee recommends that you get hired, you'll usually start your team-matching process. In other words, you'll talk to hiring managers and one or several of them will need to be willing to take you in their team in order for you to get an offer from the company.

4. Senior leader and compensation committee review

In parallel, the hiring committee recommendation will be reviewed and validated by a Senior manager, and a Compensation committee who will decide how much money you are offered.

5. Final executive review (only senior roles)

If you are interviewing for a senior role, a Senior Google executive will review a summary of your candidacy and compensation before the offer is sent to you.

6. You get an offer!

As you've probably gathered by now, Google goes to great lengths to avoid hiring the wrong candidates. This hiring process with multiple levels of validation helps them scale their teams while maintaining a high caliber of employees. But it also means that the typical process can spread over multiple months.

3. Google Data Engineer Example Interview Questions ↑

Let’s get into the four primary categories of questions you’ll face in the Google data engineer interview.

We’ve analyzed every interview question reported by Google data engineer candidates on Glassdoor, collected dozens of interview reports on Blind, and consulted data engineer interview data from Google and other top companies. 

According to our research, here are the most commonly asked questions in Google data engineer interviews:

SQL questions
Data management questions
Coding questions
Behavioral questions

In the sections below, we've put together a high-level overview of each type of question, to help you prepare.

Additionally, we've compiled a selection of real data engineer interview questions, according to data from Glassdoor and Blind. Note that we’ve edited the language in some places to improve the clarity or grammar.

3.1 SQL interview questions ↑

With Google’s backend handling billions of data fetch operations daily, engineers must be able to extract and organize huge volumes of structured and unstructured data. This requires extensive experience with SQL.

You’ll need to know how to use select statements and where clauses, joins, aggregations, and in many cases window functions and lag/lead. Be prepared to explain why you choose certain approaches over other options, and why yours is the most optimal.

Let’s take a look at some real examples of SQL questions that we found in data engineer Glassdoor interview reports. The first question is from Google interview reports, and the rest are a combination of Meta and Amazon SQL questions, to round out your preparation.

Google data engineer interview questions: SQL

Given X scenario, create tables with Y parameters, and write the appropriate queries. 
Given a dataset, find the time period when the most people were online, measured in seconds.
Given a large table with 3 columns (datetime, employee, and customer_response, which is a free text column), with phone number information embedded in the customer_response column, find the top 10 employees with the most phone numbers found in the customer_response column.
A table has two data entries every day for # of apples and oranges sold. Write a query to get the difference between the apples and oranges sold on a given day.
Given a database schema showing product sales: calculate what percent of our sales transactions had a valid promotion applied? And what % of sales happened on the first and last day of the promotion?
Given full authority to ""make it work,"" import a large data set with duplicates into a warehouse while meeting the requirements of a business intelligence designer for query speed.
3.2 Data management questions ↑

Google must collect huge amounts of data in order to remain at peak performance. Modeling, warehousing, and moving that data from one spot to another are key to keeping its systems up and running.

So interviewers will be testing you on your ability to bring datasets together to solve realistic problems that Google data engineers face daily. This may require designing data marts to support analytics use cases, designing ETL pipelines, implementing Big Data solutions, and using SQL to produce specific results, within certain data environments.

Let’s take a look at some real examples of data management questions that we found in the Glassdoor data. The first three questions are from Google data engineer interview reports, and the rest are from Amazon and Meta.

Google data engineer interview questions: Data management

What type of technology would you need to build YouTube?
How would you design a video streaming service architecture?
Build and design your own tree.
How do you create a schema that would keep track of a customer address where the address changes?
Design a data model in order to track product from the vendor to the Amazon warehouse to delivery to the customer.
Give a schema for a data warehouse. 
Can you design a simple OLTP architecture that will convince the Redbus team to give X project to you?
Given a schema, create a script from scratch for an ETL to provide certain data, writing a function for each step of the process.
How would you build a data pipeline around an AWS product, which is able to handle increasing data volume?
When is Hadoop better than PySpark?
How do you integrate data from multiple systems?
How do you design a comprehensive backup strategy for a million-scale data storage?
3.3 Coding interview questions ↑

Data engineers at Google solve some of the company’s biggest problems through code. So interviewers will be testing your problem-solving skills and ability to think in a structured way using code.

Interviewers may ask you to manipulate data structures, use dictionaries, implement loops and lists, and show a good understanding of string, set operations, recursion, etc. All of this may be done in your coding language of choice. 

Finally, we recommend reading this guide on how to answer coding interview questions and practicing with this list of coding interview examples in addition to those listed below.

The first two questions below come from Google data engineer interview reports, and the rest are coding questions from Google software engineer interview reports.

Google data engineer interview questions: Coding

How would you get top ten data (from last column) from a comma separated flat file?
How would you sum all values in a range of values between A and B?
Design an algorithm to efficiently sort and identify the n-th value.
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree. (Solution)
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. (Solution)
Implement a SnapshotArray that supports pre-defined interfaces. (Solution)
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n). (Solution)
Given a matrix and a target, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target. (Solution)
3.4 Behavioral interview questions ↑

Beyond possessing outstanding technical skills, Google data engineers must have the soft skills necessary to work in cross-functional teams. Data engineers with management positions must also prove that they have what it takes to lead teams.

Interviewers test these capabilities by asking behavioral questions, which assess you on your past behavior, looking to see if you have demonstrated good leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. To dig deeper into this question category, check out our guide on how to answer behavioral interview questions at Google, as well as our take on the ""Why Google?"" question.

The first three questions below come from Google data engineer interview reports, and the rest are behavioral questions from Google software engineer interview reports.

Data engineer interview questions: Behavioral

Why Google?
Tell me about your past experience with agile work.
If a customer says X to you, how would you respond?
Tell me about a recent / interesting project you worked on.
Tell me about a time you had to resolve a conflict in a team.
What is your favorite Google product?
Tell me about a time you had to handle trade offs and ambiguity.
Tell me about a time you were part of an organization in transition and how you helped them move forward.
Tell me about a time you used data to make a critical decision.
Tell me about a time you used data to measure impact.
4. Preparation tips ↑

Now that you know what questions to expect, let's focus on preparation. 

Below, you’ll find links to free resources and four introductory steps to help you prepare for your Google data engineer interviews.

4.1 Deep dive into the product / organization

As you've probably figured out from the example questions listed above, it's important to be familiar with Google's products and its organization. You'll therefore need to do some homework before your interviews.

Here are some resources to help you get started:

Alphabet annual reports and strategy presentations (by Alphabet)
Google strategy teardown (by CB Insights)
Google org culture analysis (by Panmore Institute)
Life at Google (Inside Google blog)
4.2 Learn a consistent method for answering data engineer interview questions 

As mentioned previously, Google will ask you questions that fall into these categories: behavioral, SQL, coding, and data management questions.

Approaching each question with a predefined method will enable you to build strong interview habits. Then, when it comes time for your interviews, these habits will reduce your stress and help you to make a great impression.

Learn how to methodically answer these questions (and more) from these resources:

Behavioral: Google behavioral interview questions
SQL: The 50 Best Resources for Learning SQL
Coding: Google Python Style Guide and coding challenges at HackerRank and LeetCode
Data management / design: Databases - system design interview concepts
Designing ETL pipelines: Designing an effective ETL pipeline 
Batch processing and streaming: Apache Spark for batch processing, Apache Kafka for data streaming
Environment: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Docker, scripting, Terraform, Kubernetes

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

4.3 Practice with peers

If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate
They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company
On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up

For those reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert. 

4.4 Practice with experienced interviewers

In our experience, practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.

Find a Google data engineer interview coach so you can:

Test yourself under real interview conditions
Get accurate feedback from a real expert
Build your confidence
Get company-specific insights
Learn how to tell the right stories, better.
Save time by focusing your preparation

Landing a job at a big tech company often results in a $50,000 per year or more increase in total compensation. In our experience, three or four coaching sessions worth ~$500 make a significant difference in your ability to land the job. That’s an ROI of 100x!

But before we get into each step, let's get to know Amazon first.

About Amazon

Amazon was founded in 1994 as an online marketplace selling books. It has since expanded into a multinational company with e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming as some of its top products. 

Amazon is currently valued at $1.954 billion as a public company. It currently employs over 1.5 million people worldwide, with office locations in every part of the world. The majority of these employees are US employees. This makes Amazon the second-largest private employer and the largest job creator in the country.

As expected from one of the world’s top tech companies, Amazon is incredibly hard to get into. But, don’t let that intimidate you. According to AboutAmazon.com senior editor, Alexis Loinaz, “Amazon goes to great lengths to support interviewees by eliminating any ambiguity from the interview process.” You’ll see this demonstrated in Amazon’s detailed interviewing page where you’ll find guides for some of the company’s roles. Also, once you get an interview, you’ll have a dedicated recruiter who’ll be with you every step of the process.

Working at Amazon↑

Here are a few things about working at Amazon that make it unique from other top tech companies.

Customer obsession

This is obvious from reading Amazon’s mission statement (""Our mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company”) and its first Leadership Principle (Customer obsession). 

No matter what role you’re in, whether you’re a software development engineer, a product manager, or an account executive at Amazon, the customer-centric approach is expected to be central to all your initiatives. 

Document culture

One of the most unique aspects of working at Amazon is its writing culture. Every meeting starts with a document, which attendees read for the first 20 minutes. They then spend the rest of the scheduled meeting analyzing the document and giving feedback. Afterwards, the document writer revises it before distributing it in its final form.

This is why you’ll find that several roles will require a writing assessment as part of the application process.

Top-down decision-making

Unlike Meta and Google, Amazon follows a top-down decision-making process, giving the executive team a relatively high degree of control. 

The company does give its function-based teams and regional groups some room to experiment and innovate to help the global company address the rapidly changing needs of customers. As ex-Amazon interviewer Dessy explained to us, teams at Amazon operate relatively independently, almost like their own start-ups. 

Great salaries

Of course, the excellent salaries on offer are likely part of your reason for applying to work at Amazon. How do Amazon's salaries compare to those of other FAANG companies? Here’s a comparison table featuring the average salaries and compensation for software engineer, product manager, and engineering manager roles.

Now let’s get into the Amazon recruitment process.

Step 1: Resume screen↑

First, you’ll need to convince recruiters that you have a strong enough profile to be invited to the first round of Amazon interviews. Here, you will either submit your application through Amazon’s jobs portal, or you will have been contacted directly via email or LinkedIn by an Amazon recruiter.

In either case, you will need a strong resume to impress them.

This is an extremely competitive step, as we’ve found that ~90% of candidates don’t make it past the resume stage. To help you put together a targeted resume that stands out from the crowd, follow the tips below.

Tips on crafting a resume
Study the job description: The work experience that you display on your resume should relate directly to the role qualifications that you’re applying for. Incorporating job-specific keywords also helps you pass the applicant tracking system (ATS).
Be specific: Use data to back up your claims. How many people were on the team that you managed? How were your successes measured? Quantify your achievements as much as you can.
Emphasize leadership: As much as you can, highlight roles and positions where you displayed some of Amazon’s Leadership Principles, but only if applicable.
Keep it simple and concise: Make your resume as reader-friendly as possible. Stick to black-and-white and don't use decorative fonts. Focus on your achievements instead of filling up your resume with your responsibilities in your previous roles.

The tips above include abbreviated information from our tech resume guides. For more detailed steps as well as examples to follow, take a look at one of our articles below:

How to write a tech resume (including examples from successful Amazon candidates)
How to write a software engineering resume (including examples from successful Amazon candidates)
How to write a product manager resume (including examples from successful Amazon candidates)
How to write a TPM/PgM resume (including examples from successful Amazon candidates)
How to write an engineering manager resume (including an example from a successful Amazon candidate)

The guides above are great starting points for you to make a competitive resume, for free. You can also read Amazon’s resume writing tips for more insights. However, if you want personalized feedback and tips from those who know Amazon’s hiring process firsthand, you may want to book a resume review service with one of our Amazon coaches.

Step 2: Recruiter call↑

You’ll likely receive an email from your recruiter if you pass the resume screening stage. You might also get a call, during which they will discuss with you how the overall interview process will work. If you have any specific questions (e.g. timeline, location, clarification about the job description), now is the time to ask. 

Usually, this call won’t include technical questions, although candidates for some highly technical roles like software engineers may receive a few low-level screening questions that test general technical knowledge. 

Otherwise, you can expect your recruiter to ask typical behavioral and resume questions like “Why Amazon?”, “Walk me through your resume,” and “Tell me about yourself.” 

Overall, Amazon interviews put a bigger emphasis on behavioral interview questions compared to other companies like Meta or Google. This is because the company is looking for candidates who align with their 16 Leadership Principles.

If you’re going to ace the rest of Amazon’s interview process, you need to be well-acquainted with these principles. Let’s take a look at them in more detail below.

Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles 
Customer Obsession: ""Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.”
Ownership: ""Leaders are owners. They think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say ‘that’s not my job.’”
Invent and Simplify: ""Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by ‘not invented here.’ Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.”
Are Right, A Lot: ""Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.”
Learn and Be Curious: ""Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.”
Hire and Develop the Best: ""Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.”
Insist on the Highest Standards: ""Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.”
Think Big: ""Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.”
Bias for Action: ""Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.”
Frugality: ""Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.”
Earn Trust: “Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.”
Dive Deep: ""Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.”
Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit: ""Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”
Deliver Results: ""Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.”
Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer: “Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.”
Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility: “We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.”

Step 3: Assessments↑

The process and content of the assessment section differ from role to role. Sometimes you’ll get it during the resume submission stage, and sometimes the recruiter will send it after you send in your resume. 

The number and type of assessment you’ll get may also differ depending on the role you’re up for. There are two general categories of Amazon assessments: work sample simulations and work-style assessments/surveys. Your recruiter email will indicate which of these assessments you’ll be getting.

Let’s take a closer look.

3.1 Work sample simulation/assessment

The work sample simulation is a sort of “day in the life” type of activity or simulation video game. Your prompts may come in the form of emails, videos, or instant messages from a virtual manager or team member. You’ll also receive materials to inform your decision. You’ll be tested on your problem-solving skills in alignment with Amazon’s Leadership Principles. 

According to Amazon’s official description of this simulation: “Depending on the role you are applying for, the assessment may ask you to interpret data from a chart, answer a customer question, choose how to resolve an issue, multitask, or find the right information from multiple sources.”

Some roles will require technical or written assessments on top of a work sample simulation. Candidates for engineering roles such as software development engineer and front-end engineer will receive a 90-minute coding challenge followed by a 20-minute system design assessment.

Candidates for roles such as product manager, technical program manager, and software development manager will receive a writing assessment. This writing assessment may be given after the technical phone screen (which we’ll cover below). It must be submitted two days before the interview loop, as interviewers may refer to it during the interview.

Prepare for the written assessment requirement by reading this article. It gives a great overview of Amazon's written document format.

3.2 Work-style assessment/survey

Amazon work-style assessments/surveys are shorter tests that ask a range of behavioral questions in order to get an idea of how well your work style will fit in with Amazon’s culture.

Take a look at Amazon’s own description of this assessment: “[They] are centered around Amazon’s peculiar culture and Leadership Principles, and typically take 10-20 minutes to complete. In these assessments, we ask you to choose the extent to which a statement represents your work style. For instance, we may ask you which of the two statements ""I like for things to be clearly structured,” or “I look forward to the opportunity to learn new things,"" best describes you.”

This assessment is frequently assigned at the end of a longer work sample simulation, as extra data for the interviewers to consider

Step 4: Phone screen(s)↑

Next, you will have one or two phone screens with a hiring manager and/or future peers. In most cases, these will be video calls using Amazon Chime, although some interviewers may opt to keep their cameras turned off.

At this point, interviewers will dig deeper into your past experience with behavioral and hypothetical questions that test specific skills related to the role.

Technical roles will also include coding on a shared code editor or word document. In most cases, it will not include syntax highlight or auto-completion, so prepare for that kind of coding environment in advance. To learn more, review our guide to Amazon coding interview questions.

Based on the official guides on Amazon’s career page, the phone screens typically last for 60 minutes. You can expect to cover both role-related and behavioral questions. Here’s a summary of the topics for the phone screens per role:

Software development engineer:  Amazon LP questions, coding and system design questions
Software development manager: Amazon LP questions, system design questions on new or existing designs
Business intelligence engineer: Amazon LP questions, SQL writing, technical questions (data warehousing, analysis, security, coding, statistics, etc.)
Product manager - technical: Amazon LP questions, technical product life cycle questions
Product manager: Amazon LP questions, questions on product management experience
Front-end engineer: Amazon LP questions, front-end coding challenge
Technical program manager: Amazon LP questions, questions on project management experience

Ultimately, if you’re prepared for the types of in-depth questions you’ll receive at the interview loop stage, then you’ll be prepared for the initial phone screens.

Step 5: Interview loop↑

The longest and most intimidating step of the Amazon interview process is the final interview loop. It may be onsite at one of Amazon’s offices, or virtual via Amazon Chime.

While you can expect interviews at Amazon to be challenging, Amazon/AWS interview coach Sergey says that its interview process is standard for FAANG companies. The biggest distinction is that it places a big focus on the Leadership Principles.

During the interview loop, you will have four to five interview rounds that last 45-60 minutes each, led by a mix of interviewers that may include your hiring manager, members of the team you’re applying to, senior management, and the Bar Raiser. 

Below is a sample interview loop schedule you might get if you apply for the SDE role.

Bar Raisers are not associated with the team you’re applying to. They focus more on overall candidate quality than specific team needs. They get special training to make sure Amazon’s hiring standards stay high and don’t degrade over time, so they are a big barrier between you and the job offer. 

We’ll talk more about the Bar Raiser in Step 6. To learn more about this unique interviewer role, you can read our complete guide to Bar Raiser interviews.

If you’ve been asked to interview onsite and are required to travel, you don’t need to worry about this. Amazon can help arrange all the logistical details for you, including any special accommodations you may require.

If your interview is remote, you’ll need to download Amazon Chime for video conferencing. Make sure to download the app on your desktop computer if you’ll be presenting during your interview.

After the interview loop, you can expect to hear back from your recruiter within five business days according to Amazon’s 2&5 Promise. This assures candidates that they will hear from Amazon within two business days after a phone interview (or series of interviews) and within five business days after the interview loop.

To help you prepare for your Amazon interviews, we have created in-depth guides to the interviews for top Amazon roles. There you’ll find a breakdown of the interview loop specific to the roles you’re applying for, plus some example questions we’ve gathered from real candidate reports on Glassdoor.

Amazon Software Development Engineer
Amazon Software Development Manager
Amazon Product Manager
Amazon Data Scientist
Amazon Data Engineer
Amazon Machine Learning Engineer
Amazon Program Manager
Amazon Technical Program Manager
Amazon Technical Account Manager

We highly recommend putting a special focus on Leadership Principles during your interview practice. Get started by reading our Amazon Leadership Principles guide. We also recommend watching and doing plenty of mock interviews. Check out the video below where ex-Amazon PM interviewer Jason answers some very common Amazon LP questions.

 
Amazon interview experiences

Based on Glassdoor interview reviews, 60% of candidates consider their Amazon interviews a positive experience, a bit worse than Apple and Google interviews but slightly better than Meta and Netflix interviews.

Those who rated the interviews positively noted that the interviews were straightforward, relaxed, and professionally handled. Some mentioned working directly with great recruiters throughout the process.

Those who rated the interviews badly noted how long the entire process took. Most described the length of the interview loops as too exhaustive and unnecessarily long. Others reported having difficulty getting interview schedules, stretching the duration of their application.

Regarding the interview questions, candidates said that they were fairly standard for the roles and nothing out of the ordinary was asked. Many mentioned how particular the interviewers were about behavioral questions, specifically about using the STAR method when structuring answers.

Step 6: Interviewer debrief / hiring committee↑

After your interview loop, your interviewers will come together to compare notes on your performance during the interviewer debrief.

Each interviewer will have written a summary of their experience with you, including the questions and your answers, as well as a final recommendation (e.g. Strong hire, hire, leaning hire, strong no hire, no hire, leaning no hire, etc.). They will review this during the debrief, along with your resume, your assessments, and any input from your screening rounds. 

The Bar Raiser is in charge of leading this meeting and is the ultimate decision-maker. They have the ability to unilaterally veto the interviewers’ and hiring manager’s decisions. However, this rarely happens. Instead, the Bar Raiser and hiring manager typically strive to drive consensus and come to a collaborative final decision.

Once the committee comes to a hire or no-hire decision, the recruiter will communicate the decision with you. However, sometimes the committee may decide they need more information about a specific competency. In this case, they will schedule one to two more interview rounds for you to complete, then reconvene to make a decision.

Team matching

In many cases, candidates interview for a specific team from the beginning of the interview process, and the final offer from the interviewer debrief comes with a team already matched to the candidate.

In other cases, candidates go through a separate team matching process after the interviewer debrief. This typically happens if the Bar Raiser or committee as a whole decides that you meet the hiring bar, but are not a good fit for the team you have originally interviewed for. 

Here, your recruiter will pass your information to other teams within Amazon, keeping you updated in the process. For the best outcome, it helps to be proactive and take a look at other open positions, sending the teams that interest you to your recruiter for reference.

Reports vary as to how long this process may take, with some candidates reporting a new team match and written offer within a week, and others taking months.

Step 7: Salary negotiation↑

Finally, once you’ve passed each of the six steps above, you’ll receive your offer package from Amazon.

At this point, all that is left for you to do is negotiate your offer. Your recruiter will get in touch with you about the details, likely scheduling one final call to clarify and discuss the terms. If they have not scheduled a call, you can ask for one.

Of course, salary discussions can be difficult and a bit uncomfortable, especially if you are not used to them. Below are some tips to help you navigate your salary negotiations. You can also get salary negotiation coaching from ex-Amazon recruiters to help you maximize your compensation.

Salary negotiation tips:
Be polite: Remember that the person you’re negotiating with is just doing their job, and that the two of you are not enemies. You’ll get much farther in your negotiations if you approach the conversation with grace.
Don’t give a number right away: Whenever possible, it’s better to wait until you receive an offer to start negotiating. This reduces the risk of giving a number that is lower than what the company otherwise would have paid, or giving a number that is so high that they are reluctant to interview you.
Do your research: Have a number in mind before the conversation begins, and back it up with data. Research your position and level on Levels.fyi, ask around on professional social networking sites like Blind, factor in the cost of living where you are, and, ideally, get some input from a current Amazon employee.
Start high: To start the conversation, name a compensation number that is higher than your goal, and the Amazon negotiator will likely end up negotiating it down to a number that is closer to your original goal.
Negotiate everything: Your offer will include more than a base salary and stock options—you also have bonuses, vacation days, location, work from home, and other aspects to consider. If the salary won’t budge, there may be some wiggle room around the other perks.

Once you’ve completed this step and accepted your offer: congratulations! It’s time to start your career at Amazon.

1. Meta Engineering Manager Role and Salary↑

Before we cover your Meta engineering manager interviews, let’s take a look at the role itself.

1.1 What does a Meta Engineering Manager do?

An engineering manager or EM at Meta is responsible for building, managing, and supporting a team of engineers across Meta’s domains, such as data infrastructure, product infrastructure, AR/VR, machine learning, etc.

As a Meta EM, you lead the goal-setting for your team, regularly checking in with your engineers to ensure you’re working towards the same goal. 

As Pranav, ex-engineering manager at Meta explained to us, ""Meta is an engineering-driven company and engineers make most of the technical decisions."" As the EM, it is your task to provide them with the support they need as they tackle these projects, whether it’s in the form of administering budgets, coordinating cross-functional collaboration, and helping solve complex tech challenges. 

Another thing that makes Meta unique is its bottom-up culture, says Tom, ex-data engineering manager at Meta. For every Meta candidate, especially those in the engineering and engineering leadership roles, ""There is an expectation that you will have a strong level of autonomy, ownership and dealing with ambiguity.""

A Meta EM is also responsible for helping shape the career growth of the engineering team. Engin, ex-engineering manager at Meta, says that the company places a strong emphasis on technical craft and individual growth. He says: “One aspect of the Meta engineering culture is that engineers are expected to influence a great deal what they want to work on and how they want to hold themselves accountable.” As EM, you need to support your engineers by helping them discern their specific strengths and find opportunities to build solutions that play to their strengths and excite them.

Lastly, the EM is the bridge between technical and non-technical teams and collaborators, including stakeholders. You need to have deep technical expertise and interpersonal skills to facilitate communication between the two.

What skills are required to be a Meta Engineering Manager?

An analysis of engineering manager job posts at Meta shows that it requires its EM candidates to have a Master's degree in Computer Science, Computer Software, Engineering, Applied Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, or a related field plus at least 3 years’ worth of experience in a computer-related field, including hands-on software engineering work.

You’ll also need to have experience coding in one of the following languages: C++, Java, Javascript, Python, or PHP. 

Finally, you'll need to have significant engineering management experience in order to be a strong candidate. You'll need to have managed a team of engineers, hired people, and helped them perform. Experience with implementing strategies and planning for risk and growth is also listed as a minimum requirement, among other things.

1.2 How much does a Meta Engineering Manager make?

Meta's competitive salary is among the numerous factors that draw engineering managers to the company.  Below are the average salaries and compensations for the different engineering manager levels at Meta. This is based on the reported data from Levels.fyi.

Meta engineering managers generally have a higher base salary and compensation than the engineering managers of other big tech companies. According to Glassdoor, the average salary of Meta EMs is 55% higher than the average salary of other engineer managers in the US.

The average salary of Meta Engineer Managers also varies depending on location or region. For example, an M2 Meta EM in the US has a much higher annual salary than an M2 Meta EM in India. 

While we presume that you already know which specific EM level you are applying for, it’s still good to double-check this with your recruiter. Your recruiter should be able to advise you on which level you’re being evaluated.

Ultimately, how you do in your interviews will help determine what you’ll be offered. That’s why hiring one of our ex-Meta interview coaches can provide such a significant return on investment.

And remember, compensation packages are always negotiable, even at Meta. So, if you do get an offer, don’t be afraid to ask for more. If you need help negotiating, consider booking one of our salary negotiation coaches to get expert advice.

2. Interview Process and Timeline↑
2.1 What interviews to expect

What's the Meta engineering manager interview process and timeline? It takes four to eight weeks on average and follows these steps:

Resume screen
Recruiter phone screen
Initial interview: 1 x 45-minute interview
Onsite: 5 or 6 x 45 minute interviews

Let's look at each of these steps in more detail below:

2.1.1 Resume screen

First, recruiters will look at your resume and assess if your experience matches the open position. This is the most competitive step in the process, as millions of candidates do not make it past this stage.

You can use this engineering manager resume guide to help tailor your resume to the position you’re targeting. 

And if you’re looking for expert feedback, you can also get input from our team of ex-Meta/Facebook recruiters, who will cover what achievements to focus on (or ignore), how to fine-tune your bullet points, and more.

2.1.2 Recruiter phone screen

In most cases, you'll start your interview process with Meta by talking to an HR recruiter on the phone. They are looking to confirm that you've got a chance of getting the job at all, so be prepared to explain your background and why you’re a good fit at Meta. You should expect typical behavioral and resume questions like, ""Tell me about yourself"",""Why do you want to work at Meta?"", or ""Tell me about your current day-to-day.""

If you get past this first HR screen, the recruiter will then help schedule an initial interview with a Meta engineering manager. One great thing about Meta is that they are very transparent about their recruiting process. Your HR contact will therefore walk you through the remaining steps in the hiring process, and will also share with you a helpful email listing resources you can use to prepare.

2.1.3 First-round: 1 x 45-minute interview

The next step after your recruiter call is the initial interview. This will usually be one 45-minute call with an engineering manager at Meta. Some candidates also have a second call that’s more technical.

You can expect the interview to include three parts:

People management and cross-functional collaboration
Technical design and architecture
Career conversation and motivation

We'll get into these in more detail below. You'll also get a chance to ask some questions at the end of the interview.

2.1.4 Onsite: 5 or 6 interviews

If you pass the initial interview, you’ll be invited to do the ""onsite"". The onsite interviews are the biggest test for Meta EM candidates. During this interview loop, you'll have five or six separate 45-minute interviews with several different engineering managers and leaders from Meta, consisting of:

Leadership interviews (people management, cross-functional collaboration, cross-functional partnerships, building culture)
Retrospectives (technical and/or non-technical)
System design and architecture interview
Coding
Product design
Machine learning

We'll dive into each of these interviews in section 4.

2.2 What happens behind the scenes

Your recruiter is leading the process and taking you from one stage to the next. Here's what happens behind the scenes at each of the stages described above:

After the initial interview, the interviewer you talked to has 24h to submit their ratings and notes on the internal system. Your recruiter then reviews the feedback, and decides to move you to the onsite/full loop interview or not, depending on how well you've done.
After the onsite, your various interviewers will make a recommendation on hiring you or not and the recruiter compiles your ""packet"" (interview feedback, resume, referrals, etc.) If they think you can get the job, they will present your case at the next candidate review meeting.
Candidate review meetings are used to assess all candidates who have recently finished their interview loops and are close to getting an offer. Your packet will be analyzed and possible concerns will be discussed. Your interviewers are invited to join your candidate review meeting, but will usually only attend if there's a strong disagreement in the grades you received (e.g. 2 no hires, 2 hires). If after discussions the team still can't agree whether you should get an offer or not, you might be asked to do a follow-up interview to settle the debate. At the end of the candidate review meeting, a hire / no-hire recommendation is made for consideration by the hiring committee.
The hiring committee includes senior leaders from across Meta. This step is usually a formality and the committee follows the recommendation of the candidate review meeting. The main focus is on fine-tuning the exact level (and therefore the compensation ) you will be offered.

It's also important to note that hiring managers and people who refer you have little influence on the overall process. They can help you get an interview at the beginning, but that's about it

3. Meta Engineering Manager Example Questions (Initial)↑

As we mentioned above, for the position of Meta Engineering Manager you'll face three types of questions in your initial interview:

Now let’s take a closer look at the three different types of question you'll face in the initial interview.

We’ve provided example questions that we’ve found from our research on Glassdoor and the official Meta engineering leadership initial interview guide. We've categorized the questions and we've changed the grammar and phrasing in some places to make the questions easier to understand.

3.1 People management & cross-functional collaboration questions

Meta engineering managers need to have superb soft skills in order to lead teams and projects and facilitate seamless collaboration between engineers and cross-functional teams. The people management and cross-functional collaboration interview is to test these soft skills and see if you’ve got what it takes to be a leader at Meta.

You’ll need to show that you can build a team and keep it motivated, solve conflicts, and communicate complex concepts. While the focus is mainly on how you manage people, you should also expect the odd project management question and general behavioral/situational questions.

Pranav, ex-Meta engineering manager, told us that Meta looks for the following key traits in engineers. As you will be leading a team of engineers yourself as an EM, you’ll want to demonstrate these traits as well:

How good are they at resolving conflict with their peers, managers, or external teams?
Do they have a growth mindset? Do they accept feedback openly and work on them to resolve it?
How well do they deal with ambiguity? How do they bring structure in place when there is none?
How do they sustain progress despite multiple hurdles?
How well do they communicate with peers, cross-functional partners, and teams?

Let’s look at some of the most frequent examples that we found in the Glassdoor data and the official Meta EM guide.

Example people management questions for the engineering manager interview at Meta

How do you manage your team’s career growth?
How do you manage difficult conversations?
How do you manage underperforming employees?
Tell me about a difficult employee situation that you handled well/not so well.
What would you do with someone who had stayed at the same level for too long?
How do you recruit good engineers?
How do you manage projects?
Describe a tough situation where you demonstrated leadership.
A tech lead on your team tells you, “I want to be a manager.” How do you respond?
Have you ever had to dismiss someone from your team?
What’s the value of one-on-ones with your team members?
How do you measure the success of an engineering team you are managing?

Find more questions to practice with by reviewing our guides to people management interviews and Meta behavioral interviews.

3.2 Technical design and architecture questions

In this technical interview, expect your interviewers to focus on your past system and product design and building experiences. The interviewer will be trying to get a sense of whether your understanding of design and architecture is strong enough to merit testing you further on it at the onsite stage.

Example technical design questions for the engineering manager interview at Meta

Describe a system/product/app you or your team built.
How did you evaluate the design of your system?
How did you test performance and scalability?
Describe the bottleneck of the system you designed.
Tell me about the most technically complex project you've managed. How did you resource your team?

You'll need to spend time looking back over a recent project and practicing explaining how you did it and the trade-offs you made. To refresh yourself on system design, you might want to read our series on system design fundamentals.

3.3 Career conversation & motivation questions

In this section of the initial interview, the interviewer will focus on your background and career goals to assess whether you’re a good fit for Meta and vice versa.

Example career conversation questions for the engineering manager interview at Meta

Why do you want to work at Meta?
What gets you excited?
How do you plan on choosing your next role?
What’s the biggest thing you want to learn?
Why are you leaving your current job?
Tell me about a mistake you made and the lesson you learned from it. 
Tell me about what you've been working on over the last year.
Tell me about yourself.
Describe something you have achieved and how you did it.

To practice with more general behavioral questions, check out our Meta behavioral interview guide and our guide on how to answer the ‘Why Meta’ question.

3.4 Your questions

At the end of the initial interview, it's your chance to ask questions about working as an engineer at Meta, as well as the various engineering leadership opportunities. Prepare a couple of thoughtful, intelligent, and relevant questions to show enthusiasm for the role and building a career at Meta.

4. Meta Engineering Manager Example Questions (Onsite)

The longest and most daunting step of the Meta engineering manager interview process is the onsite or ""full loop"". This may take place in person at Meta's physical offices, or via video call.

As explained in Section 2, you'll face 5 or 6 interviews at onsite stage, lasting 45 minutes each.

Let's go through each interview in detail, looking at some example questions and how to prepare.

4.1 Leadership interview questions

Every type of interview is a chance to show leadership skills, but Meta will give you at least two interviews dedicated to behavioral and hypothetical questions that test your leadership soft skills around managing and collaborating.


Example leadership questions for engineering manager interview at Meta

People management & cross-functional collaboration

Tell me about an employee you had to fire - how was it done?
Tell me about a time you had to deliver unpleasant news to someone reporting to you.
What attributes do you look for in senior engineer candidates?
What's your approach to 1-1s? How does your discussion change between ICs and managers?
What do you think are the components of maintaining a healthy cross-functional dependency?
How do you help people manage their careers?
How do you create alignment between talented individuals that also happen to be strongly opinionated?
How do you handle situations where an employee has underperformed?

Cross-functional partnerships

Describe a situation where you had to manage stakeholders.
Describe a challenging moment you had with another individual at your company.
A senior leader from a different org has challenged your approach to a specific problem your team is working on, in a weekly standup. What would you do next?
Describe a situation in which you and a colleague disagreed and how you managed it.

Building management and engineering culture

What's your vision and strategy for your team for the next 12 - 16 months? What's your approach to defining that?
How do you measure the success of an engineering team you are managing?
How do you balance autonomy and direction? Tell us about a time you had to move the team in a different direction to what they wanted.

To prepare for these questions, we recommend you read our primer on leadership questions in tech interviews as well as this article by an ex-Google engineering manager on how to grok engineering manager leadership interviews.

4.2 Retrospective interview(s)

You'll face at least one project retrospective at Meta onsite stage - technical, and/or non-technical.

4.2.1 Project retrospective (non-technical)

The project retrospective is a deep-dive discussion of a project that you've worked on recently. Be ready to talk clearly and specifically about the project requirements, planning, general business understanding, negotiation with stakeholders and peers, setting metrics, considering trade-offs, and scaling systems and business processes.

Remember that the 'Project retrospective' is non-technical - Meta doesn't want you to get stuck into technical details here as it's more interested in soft skills like project management and business sense.

4.2.2 Technical project deep-dive

The technical retrospective will be conducted by a senior engineer. Again, it's a discussion, not a presentation, so don't come with a slide show. However, you might want to jump up and sketch out some designs or code on a whiteboard or a piece of paper.

Start off by explaining the project at a high level, and then jump into the details.

Example project retrospective questions in engineering manager interviews at Meta

Describe a software development project you led and your approach
Describe the most technically complex project that you have worked on and why it was complex.
Talk through a project, product, or system you worked on: the design, technical problems you faced, how you solved them, trade-offs, etc.
4.3 System design and architecture

Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp all have 1bn+ monthly active users. Meta engineering managers therefore need to be able to design highly scalable systems, and the system design interviews are your chance to demonstrate your familiarity with such complex systems.

In this technical interview, you'll be asked to design a ""Meta-scale system"". It could be a Meta product, or something completely made up.  Prepare to visualize your thoughts on a whiteboard as you discuss the questions posed by your interviewers. Your goal is to show that you can be creative and structured at the same time. 

Below are some example questions gathered from Glassdoor.

Example system design questions for engineering manager interviews at Meta

Design an Uber-like app.
Design a video upload and sharing app.
Architect a drive-through system.
Design the architecture of the MVP for a restaurant recommendation service.
Design the architecture of a cloud application.
Design a mobile image search client.
Build an API to power a crowd-sourced address book.

We recommend you prepare for this interview using our Meta system design interview guide.

4.4 Coding interview

Meta understands that, as an engineering leader, you might not have coded in years. So, while you will be assessed on ""efficiency, structure, syntax, bugs, and working code"", the coding interview is not a test to see if you can write ""production-quality syntactically perfect code"". Instead, your interviewer will be evaluating how you can apply basic programming skills to solve a problem.

We've seen a few candidates reporting that they were asked to review code.

Example coding questions from engineering manager interviews at Meta

Given a matrix, each row starts with 1’s, followed by all 0’s. Find the row with the most 1’s (right most cell across all rows that has a 1).
Explore this chunk of Objective C code and find the bugs in it.
What's the fastest way to count the number of bits in a 32-bit or 64-bit integer?
Given a pattern and a string, write a function to determine if the string matches the pattern.

We recommend using our coding interview prep guide to prepare for coding questions. If you think you might face a coding review interview (ask your recruiter), use our code review interview guide to prepare specifically for this (it's written for Google candidates but it's still relevant).

4.5 Product design interview

The product architecture interview focuses on how you build a software solution with a good application programming interface (API). Where system design is all about designing back-end components for scalability, product design is more concerned with the overall user experience of your product.

Ex-Meta senior software engineer & tech lead Sidhanshu: “In discussing a product design question, we expect our candidates to explore the problem domain more fully, to think about the entities in the system, a logical data model, potentially the physical data model (how the data is stored within the client and the server), the APIs and the interactions between the servers and clients.""

Example product design questions in engineering manager interviews at Meta

Do a product design for the Instagram feed
Tell me how you’d design a client-server API to build a rich document editor.

We recommend you prepare for this interview by reading our Meta product architecture interview guide.

4.6 Machine learning interview

If it's relevant to your role, you'll face a machine learning interview.

The machine learning (ML) practical design interview assesses your skills in creating ML systems that can operate at Meta’s scale.

What the interview evaluates:

Big-picture thinking: Can you map out the full problem and solution space effectively?
Feature engineering expertise: Are you skilled in identifying and crafting the right features?
System critique and improvement: Can you spot weaknesses in ML systems and recommend enhancements?
Evaluation and deployment strategies: Can you design robust methods for testing and deploying ML models?
Architectural understanding: Do you grasp the system’s technical requirements, such as storage and performance?
Product alignment: Can you translate product needs into an effective ML system design?

Example machine learning interview questions from engineering manager interviews at Meta

Design a key value store.
Design Google search.
Architect a worldwide video distribution system.
Build Meta Chat.
5. Meta Engineering Manager Interviewing Tips↑

You might be a fantastic engineering manager, but unfortunately, that won’t necessarily be enough to ace your interviews at Meta. Interviewing is a skill in itself, that you need to learn.

Let’s look at some key tips to make sure you approach your interviews in the right way.  

5.1 Learn a technique for answering questions

When answering your Meta EM interview questions, you should focus on your most relevant achievements and experiences and communicate them in a clear way. An easy way to achieve this is to use a step-by-step method to tell your stories. 

The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a popular approach for answering behavioral questions because it’s easy to remember. You may have already heard of it. However, we’ve found that candidates often find it difficult to distinguish the difference between steps two and three, or task and action. Some also forget to include lessons learned in the results step, which is especially crucial when discussing past failures.

So we’ve developed the IGotAnOffer method (SPSIL: Situation-Problem-Solution-Impact-Lessons) to correct some of the pitfalls we’ve observed when using the STAR method.

The IGotAnOffer SPSIL Method

Situation: Start by giving the necessary context of the situation you were in. Describe your role, the team, the organization, the market, etc. You should only give the minimum context needed to understand the problem and the solution in your story. Nothing more.
Problem: Outline the problem you and your team were facing.
Solution: Explain the solution you came up with to solve the problem. Step through how you went about implementing your solution, and focus on your contribution over what the team / larger organization did.
Impact: Summarize the positive results you achieved for your team, department, and organization. As much as possible, quantify the impact.
Lessons: Conclude with any lessons you might have learned in the process.
5.2 Get used to setting up the situation in 30 seconds or less

Whether you’re using the SPSIL or STAR method to answer behavioral questions, use a timer while you practice to ensure you provide only the necessary information. Spending too much time on setting up the situation is one of the most common mistakes candidates make.

5.3 Stay focused on essential details

Interviewers hear a lot of behavioral stories each day. If you go into unnecessary details you are likely to lose their attention. Share your stories with a few different people before your interview and ask them what details they would suggest cutting.

5.4 Be proud and talk about YOU

This is not the time to be shy about your accomplishments. Concentrate on your impact, not what “the team” did. Not talking about YOU enough is another common mistake we see with a lot of candidates.

5.5 Adapt to follow-up questions

Don’t be alarmed if your interviewer asks follow-up questions; this is perfectly normal. Listen carefully to the way your interviewer is asking these questions, as there will often be a subtle clue about the specific skills they’re looking to assess from the next part of your answer.

5.6 Be honest and authentic

Be genuine in your responses. Meta interviewers appreciate authenticity and honesty. If you faced challenges or setbacks, discuss how you improved and learned from them. When talking about failure, don’t try to hide your mistakes or frame a weakness as a strength. Instead, show what you learned and how the failure helped you grow.

5.7 Be conversational

Meta wants to know if you have excellent communication skills. So make sure you approach the interview like a conversation. Ask questions about the role and what it’s like to work at Meta to show how much thought you’re considering for your application.

5.8 Get comfortable visualizing your system design process

During your technical design and architecture interview, your interviewers will want you to visualize your answer. Practice describing a past project that’s relevant to Meta by organizing it with block diagrams on a whiteboard. What your interviewers will be looking out for is how you approach a problem in a way that’s both structured and creative.

5.9 Center on Meta’s values

Familiarize yourself with Meta’s culture and core values and align your behavioral responses with them. Meta values certain attributes such as passion for technology, collaboration, and focus on the user.

6. Preparation Plan↑

Now that you know what questions to expect, let's focus on how to prepare. It's no secret that the performance bar at Meta is high. Some people even go as far as quitting their jobs to prepare for interviews full-time. This is obviously extreme and not what we recommend doing, but it shows how much effort some candidates are ready to put in.

We've coached more than 15,000 people for interviews since 2018. Below is our four-step prep plan for Meta. If you're preparing for more companies than just Meta, then check our generic engineering manager interview preparation guide.

6.1 Learn about Meta’s culture

Most candidates fail to do this. But before investing tens of hours preparing for an interview at Meta, you should take some time to make sure it's actually the right company for you.

Meta is prestigious and it's therefore tempting to ignore that step completely. But in our experience, the prestige in itself won't make you happy day-to-day. It's the type of work and the people you work with that will.

If you know engineers who work at Meta or used to work there it's a good idea to talk to them to understand what the culture is like. In addition, we would recommend reading the following:

Meta's 6 core values 
Facebook’s hacker culture (by Mark Zuckerberg, via Wired)
Meta annual reports and strategy presentations (by Meta)
Meta's approach to tech trends (by CB Insights)
Meta org culture analysis (by Panmore Institute)
Engineering at Meta 
6.2 Practice by yourself

As we've outlined above, you'll have to prepare for several different categories of questions ahead of your Meta engineering manager interviews.

But the good news is that there is a lot of overlap between the initial interview question categories and the onsite interviews.

In this article we've recommended various deep-dive articles that will help you prepare for each question category. Here's the complete list, plus a couple extra we think could be useful.

Official Meta guides: Meta software engineering leadership: initial interview and Meta software engineering leadership: onsite interview
Leadership questions
People management: People management questions in tech interviews
Collaboration and Partnerships: Dealing with conflict, dealing with stakeholders

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

6.3 Practice with peers

If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate
They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company
On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up

For those reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert. 

6.4 Practice with experienced engineering manager interviewers

In our experience, practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.

Find a Meta engineering manager interview coach so you can:

Test yourself under real interview conditions
Get accurate feedback from a real expert
Build your confidence
Get company-specific insights
Learn how to tell the right stories, better.
Save time by focusing your preparation

Landing a job at a big tech company often results in a $50,000 per year or more increase in total compensation. In our experience, three or four coaching sessions worth ~$500 will make a significant difference in your ability to land the job. That’s an ROI of 100x!

1. Amazon Data Scientist Role and Salary ↑

Before we cover your Amazon data scientist interviews, let’s first look at the role itself.

1.1 What does an Amazon data scientist do?

Amazon data scientists are essentially the link between the company, its technology solutions, and its customers. They model and transform datasets and provide valuable insights for decision-making and building customer solutions.

As an Amazon data scientist, you will analyze massive data sets of technical and business data, identify aspects/areas to improve, define/implement measurement metrics, build models to predict issues and optimize operational service, and work with various stakeholders to drive gradual improvements. 

Sergey, an Amazon data scientist, qualifies that there are three types of scientists at Amazon: Data Scientists (DS), Applied Scientists (AS), and Research Scientists (RS). ""While each role is specific to the hiring team, in general DS are more relaxed in terms of the work they do, as there is less coding bar for DS. RS are focused on research topics and publications. AS are kind of MLE+RS: they can do both coding and science,"" he says.

1.2 What skills are required to be an Amazon data scientist?

An analysis of current data scientist posts at Amazon shows that the minimum requirement for an Amazon data scientist is a bachelor’s degree or domain knowledge in the specific data scientist role you’re applying for, with strong math, computer science, and communication skills.

You will work closely with internal teams to extract information from Amazon’s existing systems to create new analyses, build analytical models, and drive business intelligence engineering (BIE)-related observations and mindsets to the technical domains. You will be the expert for this data science domain, defining tools, methodology, and goals.

Amazon is looking for data scientists with strong analytical, conceptual, and communication abilities who have a proven track record of building and managing modeling projects and forecasting solutions. 

You should be an expert in the areas of data science, forecasting, optimization, machine learning, and statistics. You must be comfortable facilitating ideation and working with different teams from concept through implementation, customer-obsessed, results-oriented, and enjoy working in a dynamic environment.

1.3 How much does an Amazon data scientist make?

Based on Levels.fyi data, an Amazon data scientist's total compensation in the United States ranges from $173.9K a year for Data Scientist 1 (L4 level) to $619.2K a year for Principal Data Scientist (L7 level). 

Below you can see the average base salary and total compensation of the different data scientist levels at Amazon US as of late 2024.

Location also plays a part in salary differences. To compare:

Amazon India data scientist total compensation range/year: $44K (L4) to $156.8K (L7)
Amazon UK data scientist total compensation range/year: $115.9K (L4) to $233.3K (L7)

Ultimately, how you do in your interviews will help determine what you’ll be offered. That’s why hiring one of our ex-Amazon interview coaches can provide such a significant return on investment.

And remember, compensation packages are always negotiable, even at Amazon. So, if you do get an offer, don’t be afraid to ask for more. If you need help negotiating, use this salary negotiation guide and consider booking one of our salary negotiation coaches to get expert advice.

2. Amazon Data Scientist Interview Process and Timeline ↑

Here are what you can expect from the Amazon data scientist interview process. and how long it typically takes.

2.1 What steps to expect

What's the Amazon interview process and timeline for the data scientist role? 

It typically takes two to three weeks and follows the steps below. If you're interviewing at AWS, you can expect a similar timeline.

Resume screen
Recruiter phone screen (~30 min)
Technical screen (1 or 2 screens, ~60 min each)
Onsite interviews (5-6 interviews, 45-60 min each)

Sergey adds, ""The interview process is standard to FAANG companies, with a big focus on Amazon Leadership Principles. There are usually 1 to 2 coding and 3 machine learning sessions during the onsite interviews.""

He also shares that Amazon has a ""2&5 Promise"" assuring interview candidates that they will hear from Amazon within two business days after a phone interview (or series of interviews) and within five business days after a panel interview.

2.1.1 Resume screen

First, recruiters will look at your resume and assess if your experience matches the open position. This is the most competitive step in the process, as millions of candidates do not make it past this stage.

If you’re looking for expert feedback on your resume, you can get input from our team of ex-Amazon recruiters, who will cover what achievements to focus on (or ignore), how to fine-tune your bullet points, and more.

Of course, if you have any connections to current Amazon employees, consider asking for a referral. This often helps candidates get their feet in the door. According to Glassdoor, 22% of candidates who got an interview applied with the help of employee referrals.

2.1.2 Recruiter screen

Once you’ve applied or been directly contacted by a recruiter, the hiring process generally starts with a brief recruiter screen call. This will be a discussion of your background as well as the interviews ahead of you. Prepare answers to simple behavioral questions (see Section 3.3) to show why you’re a good fit for Amazon. 

You may be speaking directly with your recruiter or with your hiring manager. This may not be someone with a technical background. If your recruiter hasn’t already detailed the process, this is a good time to ask specific questions about what to expect and what to prepare, as the process may differ per role.

Note: Some candidates who have been contacted directly by recruiters via LinkedIn may skip the initial call and pass directly to the technical screen(s).

2.1.3 Technical screen

As mentioned above, the Amazon data scientist interview process differs between roles, so there are a few possibilities for your technical screen. You can expect a combination of the following:

Take-home assessment
Live coding interview
Machine learning interview
Online assessment

While online assessments appear to be more common for internships, they are occasionally required for experienced roles as well. They will consist of a coding assessment or a case study for you to explore in-depth. You may be asked to present your case study as a second stage of your technical screen or during one of the onsite interview rounds.

Otherwise, your recruiter will schedule one or two interviews using Amazon Chime. Come prepared to answer machine learning questions and to work out SQL and Python/R questions on a shared notepad document.

Bilwasiva, an Amazon data scientist and research scientist, adds, ""Practical experience in setting up ML workflows on AWS infrastructure is increasingly important. Interview questions may probe knowledge of Step Functions, CloudFormation templates, and how to containerize models with Docker for Amazon ECS/EKS."" 

He also says that there can be back-to-back coding rounds in both the technical screen and onsite interviews, ""Some candidates report being tested on chaining coding problems to simulate real-world pipelines, such as processing raw data, cleaning it, and applying ML models—all in a constrained environment.""

While other companies like Google or Meta focus solely on technical skills at this step in the process, Amazon is equally interested in your past experience.

So, they might ask you behavioral questions at the start of the coding or machine learning interviews. Be ready to explain your past projects and business issues that you’ve solved, detailing concrete steps and framing them in the context of the Amazon Leadership Principles. 

2.1.4 Onsite interviews

If you crack the technical screen(s), the next step is to spend a full day onsite at the Amazon offices doing five or six separate rounds, one of which will take the form of an informal lunch interview. This may also happen as a “virtual onsite” using Amazon Chime.

These interviews will last 45 to 60 minutes and will be one-on-ones with a mix of people from the team you’re applying to join, including peers, the hiring manager, and a senior executive called the Bar Raiser.

Bar Raisers are not associated with the team you’re applying for. Instead, they focus on overall candidate quality rather than specific team needs. They get special training to make sure Amazon’s hiring standards stay high, so they are a big challenge between you and the job offer.

Bilwasiva explains, ""The Bar Raiser evaluates the long-term scalability of a candidate’s skills. For example, you might be asked to design a solution that adapts to scaling datasets without retraining models frequently (e.g., employing incremental learning techniques).""

The format of the interviews differs but may consist of case studies, technical presentations, Q&As, whiteboarding, or otherwise. Your recruiter should provide you with information on what to expect before going in. 

We’ll dig deeper into the question types later in the article, but expect an emphasis on the Amazon Leadership Principles, especially in answering behavioral questions. Each interviewer is usually assigned two or three leadership principles to focus on during the interview. 

2.2 What exactly is Amazon looking for?

At the end of each interview, your interviewer will grade your performance using a standardized feedback form that summarizes the attributes Amazon looks for in a candidate. That form is constantly evolving, but we have listed some of its main components below.

A) Notes

The interviewer will file the notes they took during the interview. This usually includes the questions they asked, a summary of your answers, and any additional impressions they had (e.g. communicated ABC well, weak knowledge of XYZ, etc).

B) Technical competencies

Your interviewer will then grade you on technical competencies. They will be trying to determine whether you are ""raising the bar"" or not for each competency they have tested. In other words, you'll need to convince them that you are at least as good as or better than the average current Amazon data scientist at the level you're applying for.

The exact technical competencies you'll be evaluated against vary by role. But here are some common ones for data science roles:

Problem-solving
Data analysis and manipulation
Machine learning / AI
Business acumen
Coding
C) Leadership principles

Your interviewer will also grade you on Amazon's 16 leadership principles and assess whether you're ""raising the bar"" for those too. As mentioned above, each interviewer is given two or three leadership principles to grill you on. 

D) Overall recommendation 

Finally, each interviewer will file an overall recommendation into the system. The different options are along the lines of: ""Strong hire"", ""Hire"", ""No hire"", and ""Strong no hire"".

2.3 What happens behind the scenes?

Your recruiter is leading the process and taking you from one stage to the next. Here's what happens after each of the stages we’ve just described:

After the phone screens, your recruiter decides to move you to the onsite or not, depending on how well you've done up to that point.
After the onsite, each interviewer files their notes into the internal system, grades you and makes a hiring recommendation. (i.e. ""Strong hire"", ""Hire"", ""No hire"", ""Strong no hire"")
The ""Debrief"" brings all your interviewers together and is led by the Bar Raiser, who is usually the most experienced interviewer and is also not part of the hiring team. The Bar Raiser will try to guide the group towards a hiring decision. It's rare, but they can also veto hiring even if all other interviewers want to hire you.
You get an offer. If everything goes well, the recruiter will then give you an offer, usually within a week of the onsite, but it can sometimes take longer.

It's also important to note that recruiters and people who refer you have little influence on the overall process. They can help you get an interview at the beginning, but that's about it.

3. Amazon Data Scientist Example Interview Questions ↑

Let’s get into the four primary categories of questions you’ll answer during the Amazon data science interview:

Coding/DSA/Modeling (35% of reported questions)
Machine learning (25%)
Behavioral (20%)
Statistics (19%)\

In the sections below, we've put together a high-level overview of each type of question. In addition, we've included a selection of real Amazon data scientist interview questions, according to data from Glassdoor. We've edited the language in some places to improve the clarity or grammar, and, when appropriate, we’ve included a link to a solution.

Many of these questions are asked in the form of case studies. For more information, take a look at our guide to data science case study interviews.

Important Note: Amazon data scientists work across many divisions, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alexa, Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT), logistics, and more. As each role will have different responsibilities, the interview questions you receive will reflect these. The Glassdoor data we’ve used is generalized across all data scientist roles, so consult the preparation materials from your recruiter to know what areas will be the most important for your position.

 3.1 Coding/DSA/Modeling questions (35%) ↑

Amazon data scientists must write code and develop sophisticated algorithms that synthesize data coming in from multiple sources. You’ll need to demonstrate that you have the technical knowledge necessary to analyze and manipulate that data.

Expect interviewers to test you on SQL, some modeling, and data structures and algorithms (DSA). Most candidates report solving modeling questions with Python or R and solving data structure and algorithm questions using Python.

Vivek, a former Amazon data scientist, adds, ""There are two rounds for SQL and coding. The best way to prepare for these is by solving Leetcode practice problems. The level of difficulty is medium. So solving Leetcode medium problems for SQL and coding are adequate.""

In most cases, you will be coding on a whiteboard (or the virtual equivalent), but some candidates have reported entirely verbal onsite interview rounds. This shows how important communication skills are to Amazon, so practice both writing your scripts on paper and speaking through your reasoning.

Bilwasiva adds, ""Expect highly imbalanced data scenarios, common at Amazon due to niche markets. Techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, and cost-sensitive learning are tested. Recent interviews for logistics-focused teams include designing algorithms for graph traversal problems, such as route optimization and dependency resolution for warehouse networks.""

He shares that there is now an increasing emphasis on explainability at Amazon data scientist interviews. ""Candidates are expected to discuss frameworks like SHAP, LIME, and techniques to justify model decisions (e.g., fairness and accountability in retail algorithms),"" he says.

Practice using the example questions below. For more help, use our list of 49 real Amazon coding interview questions.

3.2 Machine learning questions (25%) ↑

Amazon data scientists must develop services and solve problems that are endlessly complex and constantly evolving. So your interviewer will test your ability to build innovative algorithms that improve and remain accurate over time.

Depending on the role, your interviewer may ask you to define and discuss specific ideas around system design and machine learning models. More in-depth machine learning rounds will require you to build out a hypothetical model or discuss how to improve existing ones related to real-life Amazon business decisions.

According to Glassdoor, some general topics that have come up before on Amazon machine learning interviews include unsupervised machine learning, bias-variance tradeoff, principal component analysis (PCA), XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, and recurrent neural networks, in addition to the full questions below.

Let’s get into them.

3.3 Behavioral questions (20%) ↑

Amazon’s leadership principles tie into every step of the interview process, and interviewers will test your affinity with them through behavioral questions. Even in the technical rounds, your interviewers are looking for you to live and breathe these 16 principles, so spend extra time studying them.

Bilwasiva shares, ""Behavioral questions now often evaluate how candidates foresee and mitigate risks, while application of leadership principles are examined under data-backed decision-making contexts.""

He adds that while demonstrating a strong alignment with Amazon's Leadership Principles is important, it is also as important to showcase flexibility in working with ambiguous, high-pressure scenarios that are not often directly measurable. ""Interviewers are also looking for candidates with a vision for global solutions,"" he says.

If you're not already familiar with Amazon's Leadership Principles, here is the full list:

Customer Obsession - ""Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.”
Ownership - ""Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say ‘that’s not my job.’”
Invent and Simplify - ""Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by ‘not invented here.’ Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.”
Are Right, A Lot - ""Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.”
Learn and Be Curious - ""Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.”
Hire and Develop the Best - ""Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.”
Insist on the Highest Standards - ""Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.”
Think Big - ""Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.”
Bias for Action - ""Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.”
Frugality - ""Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.”
Earn Trust - “Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.”
Dive Deep - ""Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.”
Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit - ""Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”
Deliver Results - ""Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.”
Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer - “Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.”
Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility - “We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.”As you prepare for your interviews, you'll want to be strategic about practicing ""stories"" from your past experiences that highlight how you've embodied each of the 16 principles listed above. We'll talk more about the strategy for doing this in Section 4 below).

To help you start practicing, we've compiled the following list of behavioral questions asked at Amazon data science interviews. We recommend that you practice each of them. 

In addition, we also recommend practicing the behavioral questions in our Amazon behavioral interview guide, which covers a broader range of behavioral topics related to Amazon’s leadership principles.

In the questions below, we’ve suggested the leadership principle that each question may be addressing. For any principles that were not reflected in the Amazon data scientist interview questions on Glassdoor, we’ve added a question from the Amazon SDE interview guide.

Let's get to it.

How have you balanced data insights with leadership instincts when driving critical team decisions? (Are Right, A Lot)
How would you localize a forecasting model for diverse geographies with varied consumer behavior? (Invent and Simplify)

Note: For the two questions related to the principles, ""Strive to be Earth's Best Employer"" and ""Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility"", we have created our own questions. As these principles are fairly new at the time of publishing, we do not yet have Glassdoor data that address them.

3.  Statistics questions (19%) 

Amazon data scientists have to derive useful insights from large and complex datasets, which makes statistical analysis an important part of their daily work. Interviewers will look for you to demonstrate the robust statistical foundation needed in this role

Review some fundamental statistics and how to give concise explanations of statistical terms, with an emphasis on applied statistics and statistical probability. Some general topics that interviewers have asked about in previous interviews include A/B testing, normalization, and Bayes' Theorem.

In addition to these general topics, you’ll find complete questions to work through below.

4. Amazon Data Scientist Interviewing Tips ↑

You might be a fantastic data scientist, but unfortunately, that won’t necessarily be enough to ace your interviews at Amazon. Interviewing is a skill in itself that you need to learn.

Let’s look at some key tips to make sure you approach your interviews in the right way. 

4.1 Ask clarifying questions

Often the questions you’ll be asked will be quite ambiguous, so make sure you ask questions that can help you clarify and understand the problem. Most of the questions will focus on testing your technical proficiency.

4.2 Be conversational

Amazon wants to know if you have excellent communication skills. So make sure you approach the interview like it's a conversation.

Since Amazon will also be testing you on your ability to communicate highly technical concepts to non-technical people, be sure to brush up on your basics and practice interpreting them in a way that’s clear and easy for everyone to understand.

4.3 Think out loud

You need to walk your interviewer through your thought process before you actually start coding. Amazon recommends that you talk even while coding, as they want to know how you think. Your interviewer may also give you hints about whether you’re on the right track or not.

4.4 State and check assumptions

You need to explicitly state assumptions, explain why you’re making them, and check with your interviewer to see if those assumptions are reasonable.

4.5 Present multiple possible solutions

Present multiple possible solutions if you can. Amazon wants to know your reasoning for choosing a certain solution. Amazon also wants to see how well you collaborate. So when solving problems, don’t hesitate to ask further questions and discuss your solutions with your interviewers.

Also, if you have a moonshot idea, go for it. Amazon likes candidates who think freely and dream big. So if the question allows it, try to find a way to display your creative and innovative thinking. 

4.6 Be honest and authentic

Be genuine in your responses. Amazon interviewers appreciate authenticity and honesty. If you faced challenges or setbacks, discuss how you improved and learned from them. If you’re asked about your failures, don’t disguise them as strengths. Amazon values intellectual humility; admit where you went wrong and what you were able to learn from the failure.

4.7 Align your responses with Amazon’s Leadership Principles

This deserves mentioning here again, as Amazon interviews emphasize alignment with its leadership principles. Familiarize yourself with Amazon Leadership Principles and align your responses with them, especially behavioral responses.

4.8 Brute force, then iterate

When coding, don’t necessarily go for the perfect solution right away. First try and find a solution that works, then iterate to refine your answer.

4.9 Keep your code organized

Make sure to keep your code organized so your interviewer won’t have a hard time understanding what you’ve written. Amazon wants to see that your code has captured the right logical structure.

4.10 Get comfortable with coding on various medium

Amazon now typically asks interviewees to code in an online document file. But this can vary; it could be on a physical whiteboard or a virtual one. Check with your recruiter what it will be and practice it a lot.

5. Preparation Plan↑

Now that you know what questions to expect, let's focus on how to prepare. After all, the right preparation will make the difference between failing your Amazon interviews and getting an offer.

Below is our four-step prep plan for Amazon data scientist candidates. If you're preparing for more companies than just Amazon, then check our general data science interview preparation guide.

5.1 Learn about Amazon's culture

Most candidates fail to do this. But before investing tens of hours preparing for an interview at Amazon, you should take some time to make sure it's actually the right company for you.

Amazon is prestigious, and it's therefore tempting to assume that you should apply without considering things more carefully. However, it's important to remember that prestige alone won't make you happy in your day-to-day work. What will make you happy is what you’ll actually be doing as well as the people you'll be working with.

If you know data scientists who work at Amazon or used to work there, talk to them to understand what the culture is like. In addition, we would recommend reading the following resources:

Amazon's technology culture video mix (by Amazon)
Amazon vision and mission analysis (by Panmore Institute)
Amazon strategy teardown (by CB Insights)
5.2 Practice by yourself

As mentioned above, you'll encounter four main types of interview questions at Amazon: coding/modeling/DSA, machine learning, statistics, and behavioral (aligned with Amazon Leadersip Principles) questions. Use each category below to find resources to help you prepare.

To get an idea of larger innovations and research that you may be taking part in as an Amazon data scientist, take a look at Amazon.science. For more information about how to prepare for case studies, take a look at our guide to data science case interviews.

For the coding interview questions, start with the video below that shows a step-by-step method by Amazon for answering programming questions. Practice the method using example questions such as those in section 2.1, or those relative to coding-heavy Amazon positions (e.g. Amazon software development engineer interview guide).

 

 

Also, practice SQL and programming questions with medium and hard level examples on LeetCode,  HackerRank, or StrataScratch.

Take a look at Amazon’s technical topics page, which, although it’s designed around software development, should give you an idea of what they’re looking out for. For even more help with SQL, read this analysis of the 3 ""types"" of SQL problems. Note that in the onsite rounds, you’ll likely have to code on a whiteboard without being able to execute it, so practice writing through problems on paper.

For machine learning and statistics questions, Brilliant.org offers online courses designed around statistical probability and other useful topics, some of which are free. Kaggle also offers free courses around introductory and intermediate machine learning, as well as data cleaning, data visualization, SQL, and others.

Search for specific questions and answers around statistics, machine learning, data analysis, and others on StackExchange. Finally, you can post your own questions and discuss topics likely to come up in your interview on Reddit’s statistics and machine learning threads.

For behavioral interview questions, we recommend learning our step-by-step method for answering behavioral questions.  You can then use that method to practice answering the example questions provided in Section 3.3 above. This is especially important for Amazon’s leadership principles. Make sure you have at least one story or example for each of the principles, from a wide range of positions and projects.

Finally, a great way to practice all of these different types of questions is to interview yourself out loud. This may sound strange, but it will significantly improve the way you communicate your answers during an interview. Play the role of both the candidate and the interviewer, asking questions and answering them, just like two people would in an interview. Trust us, it works.

5.3 Practice with peers

Practicing by yourself will only take you so far. One of the main challenges of data scientist interviews at Amazon is communicating your different answers in a way that's easy to understand.

As a result, we strongly recommend practicing with a peer interviewing you. If possible, a great place to start is to practice with friends. This can be especially helpful if your friend has experience with data scientist interviews or is at least familiar with the process.

However, be warned, as you may come up against the following problems

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate.
They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company.
On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up.

For these reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert.

5.4 Practice with ex-interviewers

Finally, you should also try to practice data science mock interviews with expert ex-interviewers, as they’ll be able to give you much more accurate feedback than friends and peers.

In our experience, practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.

Find an Amazon data scientist interview coach so you can:

Test yourself under real interview conditions
Get accurate feedback from a real expert
Build your confidence
Get company-specific insights
Learn how to tell the right stories, better
Save time by focusing your preparation

Landing a job at a big tech company often results in a $50,000 per year or more increase in total compensation. In our experience, three or four coaching sessions worth ~$500 make a significant difference in your ability to land the job. That’s an ROI of 100x!

1. Meta Data Scientist (Product Analytics) Role and Salary↑

Before we cover your Meta data scientist interviews, let’s first look at the role itself.

1.1 What does a Meta data scientist do?

Data scientists at Meta are responsible for processing, analyzing, and interpreting data sets and using them to evaluate and make recommendations to improve Meta’s various products. They’re vital to the company’s optimization and decision-making process.

Specifically, according to Meta, you’ll be doing the following if you’re in charge of Product Analytics, which is what most Meta data scientist job posts involve:

Use quantitative tools to uncover opportunities, set team goals, and work with cross-functional partners to guide the product roadmap.
Explore, analyze, and aggregate large data sets to provide actionable information and create intuitive visualizations to convey those results to a broad audience.
Design robust and informative experiments, considering statistical significance, sources of bias, target populations, and potential for positive results. 
Collaborate with engineers on logging, product health monitoring, and experiment design and analysis.
Partner with data engineers on data infrastructure—tables, dashboards, metrics, and goals.
Drive product decisions via actionable insights

As a Meta data scientist, you’ll be integrated into what is known as a Meta Pod, which consists of software engineers, designers, product managers, data engineers, data analysts, and other functions depending on the product or service. 

It is your responsibility to use your analytics expertise to determine which opportunities to work on. You’ll be working closely with data engineers to gather data sets to extract insights from. 

You’ll also be the one to come up with the proper metrics to measure your team’s progress and meet your goals, in collaboration with the product team. 

You’ll likewise work closely with software engineers (SWEs) on experiments, from designing to monitoring and analyzing them.

Because Meta is very product-oriented, data scientists are required to have good product sense. At the end of the day, as a Meta data scientist, your responsibility is to use your technical expertise to deliver insights that will help improve user experience on Meta’s products.

What skills are required to be a Meta data scientist?

Based on an analysis of the current data scientist posts at Meta, the minimum educational requirement for a data scientist depends on the specialization. 

Some posts will only require a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, or a related technical field, while others—like Product Analytics—require a Master’s degree in a quantitative field such as Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, Information Systems, Analytics, Mathematics, Physics, or Applied Sciences. 

Having at least 4 years of relevant work experience is a must.

Experience working on experimental design and using data querying languages (e.g., SQL), scripting languages (e.g., Python), and/or statistical/mathematical software (e.g., R) are also highly sought after. 

Excellent data visualization and stakeholder communication and presentation skills are also part of the minimum skills requirement. Some posts will require experience with predictive models.

If you have all these technical skills and have been able to use them to drive business decisions in a previous role, you’re a great candidate

1.2 How much does a Meta data scientist make?

Based on the computations from Glassdoor data, the average data scientist base salary at Meta is $170K/year, which is 46% higher than the estimated average base salary of a data scientist in the US at $116K/year.

Location also plays a part in the difference in salary based on Glassdoor data. To compare:

Meta India data scientist: est. average of $11K/year base pay
Meta US data scientist: est. average of $170K/year base pay

Below you can see the average salary and compensation of the different data scientist levels at Meta US, as of early 2024, based on Levels.fyi.

While we presume that you already know which specific level you are applying for, it’s still good to double-check this with your recruiter. Your recruiter should be able to advise you on which level you’re being evaluated.

Ultimately, how you do in your interviews will help determine what you’ll be offered. That’s why hiring one of our ex-Meta interview coaches can provide such a significant return on investment.

And remember, compensation packages are always negotiable, even at Meta. So, if you do get an offer, don’t be afraid to ask for more. If you need help negotiating, use this salary negotiation guide and consider booking one of our salary negotiation coaches to get expert advice.

2. Meta Data Scientist Interview Process and Timeline↑
2.1 What interviews to expect

What's the Meta interview process and timeline for the data scientist role? It typically takes four to eight weeks and follows these steps:

Resume screen
Initial screen (~45 minutes)
Full Loop round (4 interviews, 45 minutes each)

Let's look at each of these steps in more detail below:

2.1.1 Resume screen

First, recruiters will look at your resume and assess if your experience matches the open position. This is the most competitive step in the process, as millions of candidates do not make it past this stage.

If you’re looking for expert feedback on your resume, you can get input from our team of ex-Meta recruiters, who will cover what achievements to focus on (or ignore), how to fine-tune your bullet points, and more.

It can also be helpful to get an employee referral to the Meta recruiting team internally. According to Glassdoor, 25% of candidates who got interviews with Meta were through employee referrals. So, if you do have a connection to someone who works at Meta, then this can help you get your foot in the door for an interview.

2.1.2 Initial screen

In most cases, you'll start your interview process with Meta by talking to an HR recruiter on the phone. But don't underestimate this initial interview. 

Although for many roles the initial phone screen is used to ask basic resume and behavioral interview questions, for Meta data scientists, it’s already a very focused 45-minute phone screen.

There are four focus areas during the initial screen:

1. Programming: assesses your ability to develop solutions to complex data problems using programming and scripting languages (any type of SQL is acceptable). You will be assessed based on your familiarity with common data manipulations, such as merging data sets, filtering data to find insights, handling missing data, and making coding decisions.

For example, Meta interviewers might give you the following data:

An attendance log for every student in a school district attendance_events : date | student_id | attendance 
A summary table with demographics for each student in the district all_students : student_id | school_id | grade_level | date_of_birth | hometown 

      Then, using this data, Meta interviewers could ask you questions like the following: 

What percent of students attend school on their birthday? 
Which grade level had the largest drop in attendance between yesterday and today?

2. Research design: assesses how you identify and design appropriate testing and analysis to determine relationships between relevant variables that answer strategic questions

For example, you could be asked questions on the following:

How would you design an experiment to prove/disprove something? 
If an experiment won’t work, then what’s an alternative? 
What are the downsides of the methodology you propose? 
Are there biases in the analysis or experiment that we should correct for?

3. Determining goals and success metrics: assesses your ability to identify metrics that reflect operational success and contribute to the achievement of business objectives

Your Meta interviewers could ask you the following questions:

How would you measure the impact or value of something? 
What metrics or counter-metrics would you assess when trying to solve business problems related to our products? 
Focusing on a specific dataset, what are the metrics you would actually look at?

4. Data analysis: assess how you leverage methods to answer exploratory and hypothesis-based questions that inform business decisions. These methods can range from descriptive statistics to measurement models.

Your Meta interviewers could ask you questions along these lines:

How would you prove a hypothesis is true? 
What are the hypotheses that would lead to a decision? 
Can you translate concepts generated into a specific analysis plan? 
Are you able to use data to answer the original question posed with enough detail to demonstrate the ability to execute on an analysis?
Can you lay out the steps clearly and tie this back to answering the question?

For more information on how to prepare for these, check out this Meta initial phone screen guide for data scientists.

If you get past this first HR screen, the recruiter will then help you schedule the next round. One great thing about Meta is that they are very transparent about their recruiting process. Once you've been invited to the next round, they will likely give you some additional information about what to expect in their interview process.

2.1.3 Full Loop round

The final stage in the interview process for Meta's data scientist candidates is what Meta calls its Full Loop round of onsite or video conferencing interviews. As outlined by Meta's very useful Full Loop guide, this typically includes four interviews of 45 minutes each, consisting of:

Technical skills. This is a coding interview where you'll analyze an open-ended product problem and try to solve it through code. The interviewer will assess your performance in programming, communicating effectively, data analysis, and determining goals and success metrics.
Analytical execution. In this interview, you’ll be assessed on your ability to create hypotheses for launching new products, your knowledge of quantitative analysis, how you determine goals and success metrics, and how you demonstrate agility.
Analytical reasoning. In this interview, your research design, analytical design, data visualization, storytelling through data, and setting goals and success metrics will be evaluated.
Behavioral. This is to test whether you’re a good fit for the company and the position, given your past experiences and your answers to hypothetical questions on what you might encounter at Meta. Interviewers will particularly look for how you demonstrate agility, grow continuously, partner with stakeholders, build inclusion, and communicate effectively.

For your technical skills interview, you'll need to work through your solutions on a whiteboard or the online equivalent if you're not there in person. It's also worth mentioning that the questions you're asked in the Full Loop interviews tend to be more difficult than the questions from the initial screen. So, be sure to double down on your preparation for them!

2.2 What happens behind the scenes

Throughout the interview process at Meta, the recruiter usually plays the role of ""facilitator"" and moves the process from one stage to the next. Here's an overview of what typically happens behind the scenes:

After the initial screen, the interviewer(s) you've talked to submit their ratings and notes to the internal system. Your recruiter then reviews the feedback and decides to move you to the onsite interviews or not, depending on how well you've done.
After the Full Loop, the interviewers will make a recommendation on hiring you or not, and the recruiter compiles your ""packet"" (interview feedback, resume, referrals, etc.). If they think you can get the job, they will present your case at the next candidate review meeting.
Candidate review meetings are used to assess all candidates who have recently finished their Full Loops and are close to getting an offer. Your packet will be analyzed, and possible concerns will be discussed. Your interviewers are invited to join your candidate review meeting but will usually only attend if there's a strong disagreement in the grades you received (e.g., 2 no-hires, 3 hires). At the end of the candidate review meeting, a hire/no-hire recommendation is made for consideration by the hiring committee.
The hiring committee includes senior leaders from across Meta. This step is usually a formality, and the committee follows the recommendation of the candidate review meeting. The main focus is on fine-tuning the exact level and therefore the compensation you will be offered.

It's also important to note that hiring managers and people who refer you have little influence on the overall process. They can help you get an interview at the beginning, but that's about it.

3. Meta Data Scientist Example Questions ↑

Now that we've covered the process, let's get into the kinds of questions you can expect for each type of interview. Bear in mind that the initial screen draws from the same question types as the Full Loop interviews, just in less depth.

Note that many of the questions below are asked in the form of case studies. To learn more, read our guide on data science case study interviews.

In the below sub-sections,  we've also compiled a selection of real Meta data scientist interview questions, according to data from Glassdoor. These are great example questions that you can use to start practicing for your interviews.

3.1 Technical analysis questions ↑

Meta data scientists work with one of the strongest data sets in the world. They are expected to have fluency in SQL (or equivalent), and in this interview, you can expect mainly SQL-related problems.

You will be expected to work through your answers on a whiteboard (or online equivalent), and you should be well prepared to write SQL queries (with proper syntax).

In addition to SQL questions, you should also be ready for questions related to data structures and algorithms, although these questions are less frequently asked since data scientists tend to have fewer engineering responsibilities at Meta than they do at other companies.

Finally, we recommend reading this guide on how to answer coding interview questions and practicing with this list of coding interview examples in addition to those listed below.

Meta data scientist interview question examples: Technical analysis

SQL

Provided a table with user_id and the dates they visited the platform, find the top 100 users with the longest continuous streak of visiting the platform as of yesterday.
Provided a table with page_id, event timestamp, and an on/off status flag, find the number of pages that are currently on.
Given a database of posts and a database of comments on those posts, how do you determine how many conversations are happening in the comments per post on average?
You're given two tables. One contains the date, post_id, relationship (e.g., friend, group, page), and interaction (e.g., like, share, etc.). The second table contains post_id and the ID of the person who posted. How many likes were made on friend posts yesterday?
What's the difference between a left join, a union, and a right join?
Using SQL, how would you provide a distribution of rolling 7-day average money spent per person, broken up into categories of purchase?
In SQL, how do you combine two datasets while keeping all the information?
How can you pull the unique conversation events from a database in SQL?
How do I create a validation tool for Facebook Marketplace?
Deep dive into a specific project using SQL, Python, and statistics.

Data structure and algorithms

There is an algorithm that rates posts based on their likelihood of being spam. How would you check if the algorithm works?
Given a list, search for consecutive numbers (n) whose sum is equal to a specific number (x).
Given a list of people with things that they own, find the people who have common items and what they are.
How do you revert a string?
Merge these two tables and select a row where this condition is true.
3.2 Analytical execution ↑

At the end of the day, Meta's data scientists help to drive product and business decisions. They need to be able to use their analytical skills to solve real-world business problems and contribute to the overall success of the team and company.

With that in mind, the analytical execution interview is meant to evaluate you on how you will use your hypothesis creation skills and your knowledge of core statistical concepts for data-driven problem-solving and other business decisions.

Prior to your interviews, you should take some time to brush up on statistics fundamentals and practice giving concise explanations of statistical terms (e.g., p-value, recall, etc.). In addition, it's pretty common to get questions related to A/B testing, so if you have experience using A/B tests, we'd recommend preparing a specific example in advance.

It's worth noting that Meta says you won't face any specific machine learning questions, but if you have the relevant knowledge, you can weave it into your answer to deepen the discussion.

In this interview, you’ll be assessed on four key areas:

Creating hypotheses: your ability to create hypotheses for launching new products and problem-solving; working knowledge of core statistical concepts: Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Linear Regression, Bayer’s Theorem
Quantitative analysis: your ability to quantify a feature’s tradeoffs in terms of metrics
Setting goals and success metrics: your ability to determine goals and create metrics
Agility: your ability to adapt to data changes and challenges

Let's take a look at some questions.

Meta data scientist interview question examples: Analytical execution

How would you measure the success of a product?
What KPIs would you use to measure the success of the newsfeed?
How would you improve notifications?
How will you separate “high-quality” notifications from all notifications?
Activity in Facebook user groups is down by 20%; what do you do?
Friends acceptance rate decreases by 15% after a new notification system is launched—how would you investigate?
The notification product will launch a new feature. The feature is a new type of notification. When your friends attend an event, you will get a notification. How do you measure the success of this new feature?
Imagine a product similar to Facebook Marketplace called Facebook Restaurants. Measure the success of this new feature.
How would you measure the success of a newly released feature that is similar to the Facebook group chat?
How will you gauge the success of the new notification feature in Groups? Provide guardrail metrics.
Should we launch a new notification feature? if we launch, how do we evaluate the performance?
How would you build a “restaurants you may like” recommender system on the news feed?
How would you predict churn rate?
Given a table of data, how would you create a model to detect spam?
How would you create a model to find bad sellers on Facebook Marketplace? How can you tell if your model is working?
You see ""average reels watched"" has dropped precipitously suddenly, how would you figure out what's happening?
Given a case study about a new group call feature Facebook is developing, how do you test if that would be a success?
Talk through the challenges that are involved with bringing a solution to production.

Enming, an interview coach for data scientists, qualifies, “Analytical execution is essentially about product sense. Keywords to focus on are metric design, metric measurement, A/B tests, and providing insights and suggestions to the team.” 

3.3 Analytical reasoning ↑

For the analytical reasoning interview, you’ll be evaluated on how you structure ambiguous product questions and how well you design experiments to test hypotheses, pinpointing the best data sets for specific product questions. 

You’ll also be assessed on your understanding of the downsides and biases of certain methodologies and how you plan to handle them. Lastly, your ability to extract relevant insights and tell a story through data will be tested as well.

Let's take a look at some example questions.

Meta data scientist interview question examples: Analytical reasoning

How can you find out the xxx feature on the platform? What data would you look at?
Can you find the first login for a platform, given a list of users?
How would you do an A/B test on your new metric to see if it truly captures meaningful social interactions better?
Explain your process for doing A/B testing.
What are you going to do with network effect when designing an A/B test?
How would you estimate how much fake news is on Facebook? How would you estimate its impact?
How would you use data to confirm that users’ high school data is real?
How would you evaluate the impact for teenagers when their parents join Facebook?
How would you decide to launch or not if engagement within a specific cohort decreased while all the rest increased?
How would you set up an experiment to understand feature change in Instagram stories?
How would you determine the health of Facebook Groups?
How would you determine if a new system that identified and banned accounts that were posting ads for prohibited content was working?
Your product manager is launching a new feature to improve engagement on the newsfeed; how would you guide her on whether the overall impact is positive? How would you recommend setting up an experiment?
3.4 Behavioral questions ↑

In addition to the question types outlined above, you can also expect to be asked some behavioral or ""resume"" questions about your past work experience, how you would react to hypothetical situations you might encounter at Meta, and your motivation for applying. Indirectly, these questions also evaluate your communication skills. 

Behavioral questions are a great opportunity to tell your story in a concise way and to demonstrate your alignment with Meta's values and culture. If you're applying directly to a job posting, you can also be strategic by aligning your answers for behavioral questions with the top qualifications that are listed in the job description. 

According to the Meta Data Scientist Ful Loop interview guide, when answering behavioral questions, be sure to demonstrate how you:

Operate in ambiguous and undefined projects.
Move quickly and resourcefully.
Can be open about your failures and talk through examples of what you’ve learned from them.
Build relationships and collaborate with your direct and partnering teams to achieve mutual objectives.
Influence and get buy-in from peers who may be resistant to your goals.
Exhibit introspection and self-awareness.

Let's see some examples.

4. Meta Data Scientist Interviewing Tips ↑

You might be a fantastic data scientist, but unfortunately, that won’t necessarily be enough to ace your interviews at Meta. Interviewing is a skill in itself that you need to learn.

Let’s look at some key tips to make sure you approach your interviews in the right way.  

4.1 Ask clarifying questions

Often the questions you’ll be asked will be quite ambiguous, so make sure you ask questions that can help you clarify and understand the problem. Most of the questions will focus on testing your technical proficiency.

4.2 Be conversational

Meta wants to know if you have excellent communication skills. So make sure you approach the interview like a conversation. 

Meta will also be testing you on your ability to tell a clear and concise story through data, especially to stakeholders who may or may not have a technical background. So be sure to brush up on your basics and practice interpreting them in a way that’s clear and easy for everyone to understand.

4.3 Think out loud

You need to walk your interviewer through your thought process before you actually start coding. Meta recommends that you talk even while coding, as they want to know how you think. 

Your interviewer may also give you hints about whether you’re on the right track or not. Be alert for these, and be ready to pivot once you’ve gotten the prompt. This shows you’re eager to learn and listen well to feedback.

4.4 State and check assumptions

You need to explicitly state assumptions, explain why you’re making them, and check with your interviewer to see if those assumptions are reasonable. 

4.5 Present multiple possible solutions

Present multiple possible solutions if you can. Meta wants to know your reasoning for choosing a certain solution. 

When dealing with complicated or ambiguous questions, show your ability to deconstruct such problems into groups and demonstrate how you can combine these groups for your proposed solution.

4.6 Be honest and authentic

Be genuine in your responses. Meta interviewers appreciate authenticity and honesty. If you faced challenges or setbacks, discuss how you improved and learned from them. When talking about failure, don’t try to hide your mistakes or frame a weakness as a strength. Instead, show what you learned and how the failure helped you grow.

4.7 Center on Meta’s culture

Familiarize yourself with Meta’s core values and align your behavioral responses with them. Meta values certain attributes such as comfort with ambiguity, agility, collaborative nature, and a sense of urgency.

4.8 Brute force, then iterate

When coding, don’t necessarily go for the perfect solution right away. Meta recommends that you first try and find a solution that works, then iterate to refine your answer.

4.9 Keep your code organized

Make sure to keep your code organized so your interviewer won’t have a hard time understanding what you’ve written. Meta wants to see that your code has captured the right logical structure.

5. Preparation Plan↑

Now that you know what questions to expect, let's focus on how to prepare. Below is our four-step prep plan for Meta. If you're preparing for more companies than just Meta, then check our general data science interview preparation guide.

5.1 Learn about Meta's culture 

Most candidates fail to do this. But before investing a ton of time preparing for an interview at Meta, you should make sure it's actually the right company for you.

Meta is prestigious, and so it's tempting to assume that you should apply without considering things more carefully. But it's important to remember that the prestige of a job by itself won't make you happy in your day-to-day work. It's the type of work and the people you work with that will.

If you know data scientists, engineers, or PMs who work at Meta (or used to), it's a good idea to talk to them to understand what the culture is like.

Meta recommends checking out these resources to help you learn more about the company:

In addition, we would recommend reading the following:

Facebook's hacker culture (by Mark Zuckerberg, via Wired)
Meta annual reports and strategy presentations (by Meta)
Meta's approach to tech trends (by CB Insights)
Meta org culture analysis (by Panmore Institute)
5.2 Practice by yourself

As mentioned above, you'll encounter four main types of questions at Meta: technical skills, analytical execution, analytical reasoning, and behavioral. 

For the analytical execution and analytical reasoning interviews, study our articles on how to crack product improvement questions and metric questions, as well as how to crack data science case studies. 

We created the product improvement and metric guides for product managers, but you should find a lot of the content pretty helpful. We also recommend reading up on Meta's products, as it will help to be familiar with how they work.

We also recommend brushing up on statistics fundamentals for quantitative analysis questions, which you will encounter in your analytical execution interview. 

Brilliant.org offers online courses designed around statistical probability and other useful topics, some of which are free. Search for specific questions and answers around statistics, machine learning, data analysis, and others on StackExchange.

For the technical analysis questions, your biggest priority should be to practice with example questions, especially the SQL questions. To help with that, we'd recommend reading this analysis of the 3 ""types"" of SQL problems. 

Meta recommends these resources for your analytical and technical interview prep:

Analytical reasoning/execution prep:

How Experimentation Informs Product Development: LinkedIn
The Pitfalls of A/B Testing in Social Networks
Khan Academy Statistics & Probability Course
Cracking the PM Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

Technical prep:

SQL Course
Mode Analytics SQL Tutorials
Programmer Interview SQL Practice Database
Python | SQL Comparison
Data Transformations in R

For behavioral questions, we recommend reading our guide to Meta behavioral interview questions, where you’ll find a step-by-step method for answering them. You can then use that method to practice answering the example behavioral questions provided in Section 3.4 above.

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

5.3 Practice with peers

Practicing by yourself will only take you so far. One of the main challenges of data scientist interviews at Meta is communicating your different answers in a way that's easy to understand.

As a result, we strongly recommend practicing with a peer interviewing you. If possible, a great place to start is to practice with friends. This can be especially helpful if your friend has experience with data scientist interviews or is at least familiar with the process.

However, be warned, as you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate.
They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company.
On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up.

For these reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert. 

5.4 Practice with ex-interviewers

You should try to practice data science mock interviews with expert ex-interviewers, as they’ll be able to give you much more accurate feedback than friends and peers. 

In our experience, practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.

Find a Meta data scientist interview coach so you can:

Test yourself under real interview conditions
Get accurate feedback from a real expert
Build your confidence
Get company-specific insights
Learn how to tell the right stories, better
Save time by focusing your preparation

Landing a job at a big tech company often results in a $50,000 per year or more increase in total compensation. In our experience, three or four coaching sessions worth ~$500 make a significant difference in your ability to land the job. That’s an ROI of 100x!

1. Microsoft Product Manager Role and Salary↑

Before we cover your product manager interviews at Microsoft, let's take a quick look at the PM role itself. 

Product managers at Microsoft are responsible for identifying product opportunities, defining product problems, and driving product solutions across Microsoft’s ecosystem. 

They play an active role in developing various software-as-a-service (SaaS) products for Microsoft’s different users and markets. They provide guidance and support in all things that involve Microsoft’s products. 

Microsoft product managers’ responsibilities can be categorized into four:

Market research
Product road-mapping
Management
Post-development

They oversee the product creation, development, and post-development processes and work closely and collaboratively with different stakeholders, such as product designers and engineers. They also oversee the people and teams involved in the different processes.

Given so many Microsoft products, a product manager may be assigned to several related products or to only one product for a given time period. 

According to Michael, a former Microsoft product manager, “The PM role at Microsoft is a blend of a Product Manager and a Technical Program Manager, involving a variety of tasks from strategizing product direction to handling technical issues. The balance of responsibilities varies depending on the team and product.”

What skills are required to be a Microsoft product manager?

To be a successful product manager at Microsoft, you need a combination of product management, market research, communication, collaboration, documentation, and role-related technical skills. 

We’ve examined several Microsoft job posts for different product manager roles, and they emphasize these skills over and over.

You’ll need a bachelor’s or master’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, marketing, or computer science. You’ll also need to have at least one year of product management experience, either as an intern within a Microsoft product team or as a junior product manager at a startup, although most job offers require 3+ years.

You'll need to demonstrate that you are strategic and analytical, with a strong user-centric focus, good market awareness, interpersonal relations skills, communication skills, problem-solving skills, and leadership skills. 

You’ll also need to show that you’re adept at cross-functional collaboration, as Microsoft product managers are expected to work with technical and non-technical teams alike across their ecosystem.

1.2 How much does a Microsoft product manager make?

Based on Levels.fyi data, the average total compensation for Microsoft product managers in the United States ranges from $170.1K a year for Level 59 to $760.4K a year for Level 68.

Total compensation includes additional pay, which averages at around $50K a year and can include cash bonuses and stocks.

Here are the different total annual compensations for different Microsoft product manager levels:

Level 59, PM1: $170.1K
Level 60, PM1: $178.9K
Level 61, PM2: $177.6K
Level 62, PM2: $197.4K
Level 63, Senior PM: $219.5K
Level 64, Senior PM: $260.7K
Level 65, Principal PM: $320.3K
Level 66, Principal PM: $378.9K
Level 67, Group PM: $555.2K
Level 68, Partner: $760.4K

Aside from levels, the number of years of experience and location influence salary differences. 

Ultimately, how you do in your interviews will help determine what you’ll be offered. Remember, compensation packages are always negotiable, even at Microsoft. 

So, if you do get an offer, don’t be afraid to ask for more. If you need help negotiating, consider booking one of our salary negotiation coaches to get expert advice. You can also prepare for it yourself by reading our salary negotiation guide. 

2. Microsoft Product Manager Interview Process and Timeline ↑

What's the Microsoft PM interview process and timeline? On average, it takes four to eight weeks to get an offer, but it can sometimes take longer.

The Microsoft PM interview steps:

Resume, cover letter, and referrals
Phone screen (one interview)
On-site (four to five interviews)
Hiring committee review
You get an offer!

Note: If you are interviewing for a product leadership position (VP, Director, Group PM), learn more about the process and how to prepare from this product leader interview prep guide.

2.1 What steps to expect

First, it's important that you understand the different stages of your interview process with Microsoft. Here is what you can expect:

Resume and cover letter screening / employee referral
Phone screen: one interview
On-site: four to five interviews
2.1.1 Resume and cover letter screening

First, recruiters will look at your resume and assess if your experience matches the open position. This is the most competitive step in the process, as hundreds of thousands of candidates do not make it past this stage.

You can use this free product manager resume guide to help tailor your resume to the position you’re targeting. 

And if you’re looking for expert feedback, you can also get input from our team of ex-FAANG recruiters, who will cover what achievements to focus on (or ignore), how to fine-tune your bullet points, and more.

2.1.2 Phone screen

Next, the Microsoft interview process starts with an HR recruiter call. The objective of this conversation is to understand more about your background and to confirm that you've got a chance of getting the job at all. 

You can expect behavioral questions such as, ""Tell me about yourself,"" ""Why Microsoft?"" or, ""Tell me about a product or feature you launched from start to finish."" And you should also be prepared for a couple of questions around general product thinking like, “What’s your favorite Microsoft product and how would you improve it? ”

﻿2.1.3 On-site

If you get past this HR screen, the recruiter will then organize on-site interviews. You'll typically spend a full day at one of Microsoft’s offices and participate in four to five interviews.

Each interview will last about 45 to 60 minutes and be a one-on-one with a mix of other folks from the PM team. In most cases, you will be interviewed by your future PM peers, a senior PM, and a senior executive who is likely the hiring manager leading your recruitment. 

You can expect a lot of behavioral and product sense questions (more on this in Section 3), but, as confirmed by Shiva (ex-Microsoft PM), there will be plenty of technical, design, strategy, estimation, analysis, and prioritization questions as well.

Unlike Google/Meta interviews, Microsoft interviews are less clearly defined. They could start with one type of question and go on a tangent to ask another type of question related to it. 

For example, even if the interview starts with behavioral or product sense questions, you could receive follow-up questions that test your technical knowledge.

We'll explain more about these different types of questions in Section 3.

2.2 What happens behind the scenes?

Your recruiter is leading the process and taking you from one stage to the next. Here's what happens at each of the stages described above:

After the phone screen, your recruiter decides to move you to the on-site interviews or not, depending on how well you've done in relation to the criteria provided to them by the hiring manager.
During the on-site, interviewers will make recommendation notes to hire you or not, and each interviewer will be able to see all the notes from previous interviews.
If recommended by the majority, at the end of the day you’ll be invited to what Microsoft commonly calls the “as appropriate” interview (given it is only scheduled if you have enough positive recommendations at that point). This interview is an opportunity to ask intelligent questions about the organization and show off your passion for Microsoft, the department, and the industry.
If the majority of all interviewers recommend you, the hiring team will make you an offer, usually within a week.

It's also important to note that recruiters and people who refer you have little influence on the overall process. They can help you get an interview at the beginning, but that's about it.

The good news is that cracking PM interviews is actually really manageable once you know how to prepare. 

Now, let's take a look at the different types of questions Microsoft will ask you.

3. Microsoft Product Manager Example Interview Questions ↑

The main difficulty with PM interviews at Microsoft is that you will be asked a wide range of questions. 

We've grouped them into five buckets and analyzed how frequently they were asked by Microsoft interviewers using questions reported by former candidates on Glassdoor.

Here are the results of our analysis:

Behavioral, 52% 
Product questions (design, improvement, strategy), 26%
Technical, 10%
PM knowledge, 7%
Execution (estimation, prioritization), 3+3=6%

Let's step through each type of question, discuss why Microsoft asks these questions, and take a look at a few examples in each category.

3.1 Behavioral questions (52%) ↑

As in most interview processes, you'll need to answer behavioral interview questions. Microsoft places a heavy emphasis on this area, and the questions asked tend to fall into three categories:

Your motivation to work at Microsoft and as a PM
Your past experiences
Your understanding of product management

According to Astika, a former Microsoft product manager, a running thread through all these categories is this focus: “Can you empathize with your team members? What is your leadership style? Are you a team player? ” Microsoft interviewers ask these behavioral questions to find out how good you are at working with a team.

These questions aren't particularly hard compared to some of the others listed in this guide and are sometimes overlooked by candidates. It's worth spending time to prepare answers for them, though, to build an edge against other applicants, especially since they comprise half of all questions reported by candidates at Glassdoor.

Example behavioral questions asked by Microsoft

Tell me about yourself.
Why Microsoft? (sample answer from Amazon interviews)
Why do you want to do product management?
Why do you want this job, and what can you bring that we don't already have?
Explain the PM position to someone who doesn't get it.
Tell me about a time when you had to work through a problem with a teammate.
Tell me about a time when you faced conflict within a team and how you dealt with it.
Tell me about a product you led from idea to launch.
Tell me about the most challenging product you’ve worked on.
Tell me about a time you failed.
Tell me about big-budget projects you’ve worked on. How do you ensure that you work within budget?
What’s the biggest risk you’ve taken in managing a project?
How do you know what your customers want?
How do you get people to agree with your point of view?
How can a product manager influence without being authoritative?
If you want to get something built, how will you influence the developers to build it and the senior leadership to agree with this idea? 
In working with teams, what is an achievement that you are most proud of?
How do you manage a project where you need to scale up and then scale down frequently?
How do you keep track of multiple tasks?

For more information, check out our article on how to answer behavioral interview questions, which focuses primarily on Meta behavioral questions but can be applied to any company. 

You can also watch this mock interview on how ex-FAANG interviewers answer seven common product manager behavioral questions.

3.2 Product questions: design, improvement, strategy (26%) ↑

Product questions will make up a significant part of your interviews, with questions covering product design, product improvement, and product strategy. Let’s dive into each one.

3.2.1 Product design

A core task for PMs is to help design new product features and improve existing ones. It's therefore not surprising that design questions are a part of Microsoft PM interviews.

Astika says that Microsoft wants to test your user-centricity when it comes to product design: “Can you empathize with the users? Can you brainstorm pain points for them? Can you prioritize solutions to solve their pain points? ”

You’ll also need to demonstrate the ability to think creatively within a structured approach to designing products. 

Here are a few questions Microsoft has asked in recent years.

Example product design questions asked by Microsoft

Design an elevator system.
How would you design an alarm clock for the hard of hearing?
How would you design a washing machine?
Design a 3-button remote for a television.
Design a vending machine to be located at an airport gate.
Design a kitchen.
Design a microwave oven for college students.
Design a product for campus recruitment.
Thinking of a product you’ve started using a lot lately and considering how to improve the user experience, draw out a new UI/UX.
Design the UI/UX for Disney’s new streaming platform.
Design the most engaging user interface for a music app that you can think of.
How would you design a Microsoft cell phone?
A new building owner wants an elevator to be constructed. What are some of the questions you will ask them or the factors you will consider before you give them the final recommendation? 
If you were to design an app for selling and buying antiques, how would you do it?

For more information, check out our guide on how to answer product design questions in PM interviews.

3.2.2 Product improvement

Product improvement questions are frequently asked during product manager interviews for interviewers to assess your ability to create a methodical thought process given uncertain situations and explain the product and the pain points it addresses for different user groups.

Product improvement questions also aim to assess how you are able to identify the problems with the product that users of different segments have, think of innovative ways to improve the product, evaluate your options and create a product roadmap with clear priorities.

Example product improvement questions asked by Microsoft

What’s your favorite product, and how would you improve it?  
How would you improve a past project you worked on?
Choose a popular product in the market. How would you improve it?
What’s your favorite product, and why? How would you improve it?
How would you improve a specific product line if the goal is to acquire new users?
Choose a relevant app you use. What would you improve? Why?
How would you add food ordering to Excel?

To learn more, check out our guides on how to answer product improvement questions and the favorite product question in PM interviews.

3.2.3 Product strategy 

PMs are responsible for setting the product vision and roadmap to deliver it. In other words, they're in charge of product strategy.

In your interviews, you'll therefore be given strategic questions to discuss with your interviewer. These questions assess if you're comfortable thinking about the wide range of aspects good PMs need to take into account when making product decisions. This includes competition, pricing, marketing, time to market, etc.

Thinking through all these aspects requires creativity and a structured approach. 

Example product strategy questions asked by Microsoft

Imagine you’re a PM at a startup that works with big data. Now what?
If you were a PM on Microsoft Surface and Delta asked you to design the perfect airline entertainment system, what would you do? Walk through your thoughts and pitch it.
How would you monetize Outlook?
Take any production chain; how can you optimize the production process?
How would you motivate users to use your app every single day for a month?
You are the king of an island. You want to switch which side of the road everyone is driving on. How do you go about doing it?
How would you define a product strategy for a new AI-powered productivity tool?
Choose a target customer to build an MLP (minimum loveable product) for. Brainstorm multiple features to add to this to scale the product over time.
How would you assess whether or not to discontinue a product?

For more information, check out our article on how to answer product strategy interview questions.

3.3 Technical questions (10%) ↑

Microsoft expects a fair amount of technical knowledge from candidates. Microsoft PMs tend to be more technical than average, usually having a degree in computer science or significant previous experience with software and engineering.

Astika explains that Microsoft interviewers want to know if you have sufficient abilities in these: “Do you understand the basics of how tech works in software products? Can you speak the language of engineers?

As a consequence, you'll typically need to answer a few technical questions during your interview process. 

As you can see below, these questions are not a test of coding expertise in any particular language. They are centered on whether or not you understand and can offer simple explanations of certain technical concepts—especially algorithms.

Example technical questions asked by Microsoft

How would you explain Cloud to your grandmother?
How would you explain recursion to somebody who is not technical?
How does DNS work?
What is the runtime of merge sort, and why?
What is the difference between C++ and Java?
Given a list with an unknown number of elements, how would you find and then remove the second-to-last element in the list?
Explain the concept of big O notation.
Design a method that removes every other node from a linked list.
How does the internet work?
Explain heap sort. What is time and space complexity?
For a boggle game (4x4 matrix) with letters in each block, how would you think about an algorithm such that it can give a list of all the words (minimum 2 letters long) in the matrix? It has to be the adjacent letter and can be in any direction (left, right, up, down, diagonal). 

For more information, check out our article on how to answer technical interview questions.

3.4 PM knowledge questions (7%) ↑

Product management (PM) knowledge questions are designed to assess your understanding of core product management principles, methodologies, and best practices. They are your ability to think strategically, solve problems, and make data-driven decisions.

Product managers play a pivotal role in a company's success by bridging the gap between technical teams and business objectives. These questions help interviewers evaluate your ability to be a good product manager. 

These questions can involve product management approaches and techniques, product lifecycle management, market analysis, and problem-solving.

Example PM knowledge questions asked by Microsoft

Describe the Waterfall technique in product management.
How do you identify a critical path?
What product KPIs have you used, and how did they help you in managing products?
What are the key metrics to track at each stage of a product's lifecycle?
How would you conduct a competitive analysis for a new cloud-based gaming service?
Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision based on incomplete data. How did you approach the situation?

To learn more or brush up on your product management knowledge, check out this guide on essential product management tools.

3.5 Execution questions:  metric, estimation and prioritization (6%) ↑

Good PMs are critical thinkers and can make confident and swift decisions. Making these decisions often requires analytical, estimation, and prioritization skills, which Microsoft will test you on in the on-site interviews.

Analysis or metric questions: These questions test how well you work with available data. A good PM can identify the correct KPIs for a product and use them to deliver results.

Astika says that Microsoft particularly emphasizes analytical or metric questions. “Can you set key metrics for a product? Can you discuss the trade-offs and pitfalls of your main metrics? Can you set a north star metric?

Estimation questions: In estimation questions, interviewers don't care so much about whether you get to the right answer or not. What they are really interested in is how you think through the problem and how comfortable you are making assumptions and simple calculations.
Prioritization questions: Microsoft interviewers also like to ask prioritization questions to assess your decision-making ability when making trade-offs. They want to see that you are capable of using frameworks in structuring your approach.

Example execution questions asked by Microsoft

Analysis or metric questions

How would you track user engagement in an app, and what KPIs would you use to improve it?
What metrics would you use to measure success for Microsoft Outlook?
How would you set goals for a Microsoft product of your choice?
For products like Windows, there are millions of customers; how do you test for all?

Estimation questions 

How much money do Americans spend on cat food every year?
How would you go about estimating the number of gas stations in the USA?
How would you weigh a plane without a scale, but other tools at your disposal?
There are 24 holes in the key. How many combinations of passwords can you think of?

Prioritization questions

Describe your product framework for prioritization.
How do you prioritize work items?
How would you prioritize features for a product with limited resources and a tight deadline?

For more information, check out our articles on how to answer metric questions, estimation questions, and prioritization questions in PM interviews.

4. Interview tips ↑

You might be a fantastic product manager, but unfortunately, that’s not necessarily enough to ace your interviews at Microsoft. Interviewing is a skill in itself that you need to learn.

Let’s look at some key tips to make sure you approach your interviews in the right way. Below, you’ll find links to free resources and twelve introductory steps to help you prepare for your Microsoft PM interviews.

4.1 Deep dive into the product / organization

As you've probably figured out from the example questions listed above, you can't become a PM at Microsoft without being familiar with the company's products and its organization. You'll therefore need to do some homework before your interviews.

Here are some resources to help you get started with this:

Microsoft Vision and Mission (Microsoft)
Microsoft Vision and Mission Analysis (Panmore Institute)
Microsoft Strategy Teardown (CB Insights)
Microsoft Interview Tips (Microsoft Careers)
Microsoft Hiring Tips (Microsoft Careers)
The Official Microsoft Blog (Microsoft)
Microsoft Annual Reports (by Microsoft)
4.2 Learn a consistent method for answering PM interview questions

As mentioned previously, Microsoft will ask you questions that fall into certain categories like behavioral, design, strategy, estimation, and metric questions. Approaching each question with a predefined method will enable you to build strong interview habits.

Then, when it comes time for your interviews, these habits will reduce your stress and help you to make a great impression.

If you’re just looking for a jumping-off point, you can start learning about the different question types you’ll need to master in the following blog articles:

Behavioral questions
Product design questions
Product improvement questions
Favorite product question
Strategy questions
Metric questions
Technical questions
Estimation questions
Prioritization questions

Once you understand how to answer each question type, you also need to be able to communicate your answers clearly under the pressure of interview conditions. That’s where practice comes into play.

​4.3 Ask clarifying questions

Some of the questions you will be asked will be quite ambiguous. In those cases, you’ll need to ask clarifying questions to get more information about the problem and to reduce its scope.

Jumping straight in without asking questions first will be a red flag to the interviewer and will hinder your answer.

For instance, if you were asked, “What would be your 10-year strategy if you were CEO?” you can respond by asking some questions about the company’s current situation and any business objectives the interviewer may have in mind. This way, you’ll have a better understanding of what the company needs in the coming years and have more information from which to build a strategy.

4.4 Justify your choices

Microsoft wants to see the reasoning behind your answer, so make sure to justify each decision you make. You'll need to make plenty of trade-offs as you arrive at a solution, so be sure to call them out.

4.5 Be data-driven, but not too data-driven

Microsoft is looking for product managers who can make decisions based on data and can judge everything they do by relevant metrics.

In an interview situation, it's okay to make assumptions because you might not have access to the facts and data. But you need to make it clear that in real life, you would seek out that data and that your approach would be highly data-driven.

4.6 Demonstrate user empathy

Microsoft wants product managers who can empathize with its users.

When answering a PM interview question, your first instinct should be to focus on the user. Identify who uses the product, why, and what the use cases are. Avoid designing a product based solely on personal preferences.

As part of your prep, think hard about the different kinds of users across Microsoft’s ecosystem and be prepared to divide them into segments.

4.7 Check in with your interviewer

Interviewers differ in their willingness to provide hints. Some may wait for you to ask about customer or product details, while others expect you to make assumptions on your own.

Gauge this by asking a direct question or specifying your assumptions. If the interviewer tends to offer specifics, they’ll engage. If not, limit additional questions to demonstrate your ability to make decisions independently.

4.8 Answer methodically by using a framework

Like other tech companies, Microsoft wants you to solve a problem methodically. 

You can use the common STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework when answering behavioral questions, but we recommend our more focused SPSIL (Situation-Problem-Solution-Impact-Lessons) framework for leadership and behavioral questions

We also recommend the BUS (Business Objective-User Problems-Solutions) framework for product design, improvement, prioritization, and strategy questions, and the CEC framework for technical questions.

4.9 Don’t get stuck in a framework

As we just said above, frameworks are extremely helpful. However, some of our successful candidates have mentioned that excessive reliance on frameworks may hinder your performance.

During the interview, trust your instinct, and don’t be afraid to deviate from the framework if needed. A framework is there to help you craft a better answer, not make you twist your answer to fit the framework.

4.10 Center on the company’s core values

Also, study Microsoft’s culture guide. When answering leadership interview questions, share stories from past experiences that align with Microsoft’s core values. When designing a product or a strategy, consider how your answer aligns with these values.

4.11 Treat the interview like a conversation

Keep in mind that the interview is a two-way discovery process. While the interviewer assesses if you’re a good fit for Microsoft, you’re also evaluating if the company aligns with your aspirations and preferences.

4.12 Save questions and feedback for your interviewer

You’ll have a few minutes to ask your interviewer questions as the interview wraps up. Arriving without questions may suggest a lack of interest in the company or the role.

Prepare thoughtful questions that go beyond what you could have found out online. You can ask about career growth opportunities or specific ways of working in the company. It's your chance to showcase genuine curiosity and investment in the conversation.

5. How to prepare for Microsoft PM interviews ↑

We've coached more than 15,000 people for interviews since 2018. There are essentially three activities you can do to practice for interviews. Here’s what we've learned about each of them.

5.1 Learn by yourself

Learning by yourself is an essential first step. We recommend you make full use of the free prep resources on this blog and also watch some mock interviews on our product management YouTube channel. This way you can see what an excellent answer looks like.

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

5.2 Practice with peers

If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate.
They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company.

 1. TikTok Product Manager Role and Salary↑

Before we cover your product manager interviews at TikTok, let's take a quick look at the company and the PM role itself. 

ByteDance Ltd., a Chinese technology company that developed new video-sharing social networking applications, owns TikTok.

Headquartered in Beijing and incorporated in the Cayman Islands, ByteDance also owns Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, and Toutiao, a news and information content platform with a content recommendation engine. It also owns several other apps through mergers and acquisitions, such as Musical.ly, News Republic, Helo, and Vigo Video.

1.1 What does a TikTok product manager do?

Product managers at TikTok are responsible for identifying product opportunities, defining product problems, and driving product solutions across TikTok’s ecosystem.

The TikTok product manager role can be broken down into 3 parts: 

Setting the strategy and vision for what that feature or product is going to be like
Determining what success looks like and how to measure it
Execution and building

Applying for a product manager position at TikTok will allow you to explore different specializations. Some specializations include managing content, customer products, data products, inventory, marketing automation, privacy and responsibility, responsible AI, search, seller acquisition, seller transactions, seller growth, seller risk, TikTok Effect, TikTok Shop recommendations, and vertical ad platforms.

According to Melody Chu, a former TikTok product manager, TikTok gives PMs a big scope regardless of years of experience. “At TikTok, if you think it, you can (usually) build it... TikTok takes chances on first-time PMs,” she explains. 

What skills are required to be a TikTok Product Manager?

To be a successful product manager at TikTok, you need a combination of product management, communication, collaborative, and role-related technical skills. We’ve examined several TikTok job posts for different product manager roles, and they emphasize these skills over and over.

You’ll need a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field with at least three years of experience in the area of the role you’re applying for. You’ll need to demonstrate a good grasp of product management concepts and tools, as well as the TikTok business model and how it applies to your potential role as product manager.

You'll need to demonstrate that you are strategic and analytical, with a strong user-centric focus, with good market awareness, interpersonal relations skills, communication skills, problem-solving skills, and leadership skills. 

You’ll also need to show that you’re adept at cross-functional collaboration, as TikTok PMs are expected to work with technical and non-technical teams alike across their ecosystem.

1.2 How much does a TikTok Product Manager make?

To have an idea of the differences in salaries across product manager role levels, here are the annual total compensation of five different product manager role levels at ByteDance (since there are no levels data for TikTok at the time of writing), based on Levels.fyi data:

Level 2-1: $229.7K
Level 2-2: $306.6K
Level 3-1: $451.7K
Level 3-2: $486.8K
Level 4-1: $573.3K

Where you’re located will impact your salary, too. TikTok has 10 offices and over 10,000 employees worldwide, with two in the United States (Los Angeles headquarters and New York office) and the rest spread across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. 

Ultimately, how you do in your interviews will help determine what you’ll be offered. Remember, compensation packages are always negotiable, even at TikTok. 

So, if you do get an offer, don’t be afraid to ask for more. If you need help negotiating, consider booking one of our salary negotiation coaches to get expert advice. You can also prepare for it yourself by reading our salary negotiation guide. 

2. TikTok Product Manager Interview Process and Timeline ↑

The interview process for TikTok PMs typically takes about one to three months to complete.

Here’s a quick overview of the steps you may face along the way:

Resume, cover letter, and referrals
Recruiter phone screen (30-45 min)
Hiring manager phone screen (45-60 min)
PM interviews (2-3 rounds, 45-60 min each)
[In some cases] Engineering interview (1 round, 45-60 min)
Final HR interview (1 round, 45-60 min)

TikTok’s interview process is very different from other major tech companies like Meta, Amazon, or Google. Firstly, TikTok’s interviews do not typically culminate with an in-person or virtual onsite loop. Instead, candidates have a series of progressive interviews, which are usually conducted over video call.

Additionally, each of TikTok’s interview rounds is eliminatory, meaning that you have to pass each individual round to move on to the next. At other companies, you may be able to make up for one “just ok” round with a stellar performance at the others, but at TikTok, you’ll need to ace every interview to continue.

Finally, one or multiple of your rounds may take place with a member of the team in China. This means that you’ll have to be flexible with your schedule to accommodate a Chinese time zone, and your interviewer may not be a native English speaker.

Now, let’s get into each step of the TikTok interview process. There is some variation in past candidates’ experiences, so we’ll cover the most frequently mentioned steps that have been reported on Glassdoor, Blind, and Rooftop Slushie.

If you are interviewing for a product leadership position (VP, Director, Group PM), learn more about the process and how to prepare in this product leader interview prep guide.

2.1 Resume, cover letter, referrals

First, recruiters will look at your resume and assess if your experience matches the open position. This is the most competitive step in the process, as millions of candidates do not make it past this stage.

You can use this free product manager resume guide to help tailor your resume to the specific position you’re targeting. 

And if you’re looking for expert feedback, you can also get input from our team of ex-FAANG recruiters, who will cover what achievements to focus on (or ignore), how to fine-tune your bullet points, and more.

2.2 Recruiter phone screen

Next, you'll usually start your interview process by talking to an HR recruiter on the phone. They are looking to confirm that you've got a chance of getting the job at all, so be prepared to explain your background and why you’re a good fit at TikTok. 

You should expect typical behavioral and resume questions like, ""Tell me about yourself,"" ""Why TikTok?"" or ""Tell me about a product you launched from start to finish.""

This would also be a good time to ask for any clarifying information you need to know for the interviews moving forward. The recruiter will be your point person for the rest of the process. 

2.3 Hiring manager phone screen

After talking with the recruiter, your next step is a call with a hiring manager, which should last roughly around 45 minutes.

During this interview, expect a deep dive into the experiences that you’ve listed on your resume. It is likely that the interviewer will pick one to two projects and ask detailed questions about your impact, so prepare key talking points on your past projects.

This phone screen might end with a 10-15-minute case study testing your product design and strategy skills. The case study will represent an everyday problem faced at TikTok.

If you pass this round, then you’ll move on to the PM interviews. 

2.4 PM interviews

After the hiring manager screen, you’ll have two to three interviews with TikTok PMs. They may come from the team you’re applying to join, from other teams that you’ll need to collaborate with, or they may be product leaders that you’ll be reporting to. 

You can expect these interviews to have the rigor of onsite interview rounds at other big tech companies, even though they’ll be happening progressively, with hours or days between each round. As we mentioned before, you must pass each individual interview before moving on to the next.

The interviewers will ask you a mix of behavioral, product sense, and execution questions. We’ll dive deeper into these types of questions and how to prepare for them in Section 3.

2.5 [In some cases] Engineering interview

Some candidates report an interview with the engineering team that they’ll be working with if hired. This may take place before or in between the PM interview rounds.

The engineering interview is meant to test your cross-functional collaboration and technical skills. You’ll likely be asked to explain specific technical concepts or to solve basic technical problems.

The exact technical questions that you’ll be asked will depend on your background. It is unlikely that you will have to code in one of these sessions, although you may have to write pseudocode. 

We’ll give you more information about technical questions in PM interviews in Section 3.

2.6 Final HR interview

Finally, if you pass each of the previous interviews, you’ll be scheduled for one last interview with TikTok’s HR team.

If you make it to this round, it is very likely that you will receive an offer, although there are rare cases of candidates getting rejections after completing this interview.

You will be asked a few more behavioral questions to test your cultural fit with TikTok, as well as what you expect out of the role. They may ask for feedback on the previous interview rounds as well as your salary expectations. 

After this interview is finished, all you have to do is wait until you (hopefully) receive your offer. And if you need help negotiating your offer, you might want to get help from our salary negotiation coaches. 

3. TikTok Product Manager Example Questions ↑

Now that you have an idea of the interview process at TikTok, let’s dive into the four types of questions that you can expect. The question categories are very similar to those in Meta’s PM interview process, with the addition of technical questions for some candidates. We've had a couple of candidates reporting that they were given a case, but it seems to be rare.

While each of the Meta PM interview rounds focuses on one category at a time, the TikTok interview rounds typically include a mix of questions from two or more categories (e.g. product sense and execution).

Here are the categories:

We've analyzed questions reported by former TikTok PM candidates on Glassdoor and Blind, and we’ve categorized the real questions asked for each interview type, listed below. 

Note that some questions have been edited for clarity or grammar.

Let’s get started.

3.1 Leadership interview questions (55%) ↑

PMs must collaborate with a variety of different teams (e.g. engineers, data analysts, designers, etc.) in order to achieve project and organizational goals. To do this, they have to be able to motivate others, address conflicts, and build relationships. 

At TikTok, you’ll be given a great deal of autonomy to make plans, advocate for them, and push the plans through. So interviewers will ask you questions to test whether you can act in ambiguous circumstances and unite people around your ideas.

This is the most frequently reported type of question asked in TikTok interviews, so come with a list of stories from your past experience that you can use to answer questions such as the ones below.

Example PM interview questions asked at TikTok: Leadership

General

Why TikTok? (sample answer from Amazon interviews)
Tell me about yourself / your past experience.
Tell me about [specific project on your resume].
What do you see as being the job of a product manager?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
If I talked to your last boss, what would they say is one thing you need to work on?
Tell me about a time that you failed and what you learned from the experience
Why do you want to leave your current company after working there for so many years?
What do you think about working overtime?
How do you handle working in a fast-paced environment?

Collaboration

What is your leadership style?
How do you sell your ideas to teams of engineers?
What is your experience working with cross-functional teams?
Describe a time you built a product with many cross-functional departments.
How do you work with difficult stakeholders?
How do you deal with engineers who are not willing to contribute, or who decline the product manager's ideas?
How do you collaborate with cross-functional teams, such as engineers and designers, to ensure successful product launches?

Project management and prioritization

Tell me about the project that you are the most proud of
What tools do you use to increase your efficiency?
How do you approach collaboration and project management when announcing a new feature to consumers?
How do you prioritize competing priorities?
How would you prioritize features to build a moderation tool?

For more information, take a look at our behavioral interview guide, which is targeted at Meta but contains a method that is applicable everywhere.

3.2 Product sense interview questions (31%) ↑

TikTok PMs pinpoint which problems are the most important to solve, and then help design solutions for them. This requires a strong product sense.

This is an important part of the interview to show your familiarity with TikTok’s products, their main challenges, and how you would address them as PM. Your interviewers want to see that you can tackle the kinds of problems that they face every day, concentrating on a great user experience.

Expect to play the role of a PM at TikTok, calling the shots for a team. This may come in the form of open-ended questions or more in-depth case studies. In both cases, practice explaining your reasoning out loud to give your interviewer a clear idea of your approach and working style.

In the questions below, you’ll find a mix of product design, product improvement, product strategy, and estimation questions, although there were very few estimation questions reported by candidates. We recommend studying the articles we've written on each topic to learn how to answer these questions in a structured and impactful way.

Right, let’s get to some questions.

Example PM interview questions asked at TikTok: Product sense

Product design question

What is the difference between YouTube, TikTok, and Xiaohongshu?
Compare the home screens of TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. 
How would you design TikTok for an older audience? 
Design a mobile app for the Olympics.
Tell us about a good video you've seen on TikTok.

Product improvement questions

How do you use data to improve a product?
How would you improve TikTok?
What is one feature you will add to the TikTok app and why?
What are the pain points you have in using the TikTok app, and how would you address these pain points if you were the product manager?
Tell me about a product you like, how you would improve it, and why?

Product strategy questions

If you were in charge of X current project, what would you do?
What would you build if you were the product manager of Instagram in Japan during the run-up to the Olympics?
What are the current trends and strategies in ad content?
What are the trends you noticed in TikTok?
What TikTok advertising formats are you familiar with?
What do you think the social media landscape will look like in 10 years?
What are the challenges TikTok faces in France/your home country?
How do you gather and analyze user feedback to inform product decisions?
Imagine that you got user feedback to build a video scrubber on TikTok. What do you do?
Who are TikTok's competitors? How are they different and how could they be more different?

Estimation question

How many creators are there in India?

To look at the product sense interview in a bit more detail, check out our comprehensive product sense interview guide. Although this guide focuses on Meta, the guidelines could apply to any company.

3.3 Execution interview questions (12%) ↑

Once PMs have nailed down a strategy, settled on a product design, and decided which problems to solve, it's time to execute. 

TikTok asks execution questions to test how you analyze the success of a product or feature, and how you prioritize important tasks. Show how you find and measure the most relevant data in order to solve problems.

Below, we’ve listed the real execution questions that past candidates have reported on Glassdoor. You’ll notice product metric and prioritization questions in the mix, so practice a framework to answer these questions with precision.

Example PM interview questions asked at TikTok: Execution

How would you filter out “junk” content and measure the effect of this?
How would you assess X feature if you were the product manager on it?
You are the PM for TikTok's Android app. The app's Play Store rating has dropped drastically from 4.2+ to 2 in India in less than a week's time. It is mostly due to a surge of trolls downrating the app. What is your plan of action?
How do you prioritize Sales needs versus Engineering needs?
Describe all the metrics we need to focus on the app's Ads.
How do you evaluate metrics when you define the e-commerce shop?
Describe a product that you launched in the past and its impact on the market.

To learn more, check out our comprehensive guide on how to answer execution interview questions. This guide focuses on Meta but could apply to any company. 

3.4 Technical interview questions, in some cases (2%) ↑

Finally, PMs must work with teams of engineers to achieve project goals. Interviewers test your ability to do this by asking a mix of technical questions.

This is the least common type of question for PMs at TikTok, as it seems to be reserved for the candidates who are assigned an interview round with an engineering team. These questions are not frequently reported in the PM or hiring manager interview rounds.

If asked a technical question, it is unlikely that you will have to write actual code. Instead, interviewers will test your technical knowledge by asking you to explain a technical concept or to solve a problem using pseudocode.

The first question below is a real TikTok PM interview question reported on Glassdoor. The rest are technical PM interview questions asked at companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon, which we’ve included to help round out your practice.

Example PM interview questions asked at TikTok: Technical

Describe precision and recall in data science
Explain the concept of ""protocol"" to a 4-year-old child
What is the difference between C++ and Java?
Explain what happens when executing mergesort.
Write a program to randomly shuffle an array of numbers
How would you output a tree in column sequence from left to right?
Invert the words of a sentence in a string

You can learn a step-by-step process for solving this type of question and find additional practice questions by reading our guide on how to answer technical questions in PM interviews.

4. TikTok Product Manager Interview Tips ↑

Now that you know what questions to expect, let's focus on preparation. 

Below, you’ll find links to free resources and introductory steps to help you prepare for your TikTok PM interviews.

4.1 Deep dive into the product / organization

As you can see from the questions above, it will be very difficult to secure an offer from TikTok if you come to the interviews without having researched the company first. The questions will frequently center around real-life problems the TikTok product team is facing now or has faced in the past.

So you’ll need to do homework before your interviews.

Study TikTok’s culture guide. When answering leadership interview questions, share stories from past experiences that align with TikTok’s core values. When designing a product or a strategy, consider how your answer aligns with these values.

Additionally, here are some resources to get you started on the right track:

TikTok's newsroom (by TikTok)
TikTok revenue and usage statistics (by BusinessforApps)
TikTok’s business model (by Business Model Toolbox)
TikTok stats (by Viralyft)
4.2 Learn a consistent method for answering PM interview questions

As mentioned previously, TikTok will ask you questions that fall into certain categories like behavioral, design, strategy, estimation, and metric questions. Approaching each question with a predefined method will enable you to build strong interview habits.

Then, when it comes time for your interviews, these habits will reduce your stress and help you to make a great impression.

If you’re just looking for a jumping-off point, you can start learning about the different question types you’ll need to master in the following blog articles:

Product sense interview (can apply to any company)
Product design questions
Product improvement questions
Product strategy questions
Meta execution interview (can apply to any company)
Metric questions
Prioritization questions
Meta behavioral questions (can apply to any company)

Once you understand how to answer each question type, you also need to be able to communicate your answers clearly under the pressure of interview conditions. That’s where practice comes into play.

4.3 Ask clarifying questions

Some of the questions you will be asked will be quite ambiguous. In those cases, you’ll need to ask clarifying questions to get more information about the problem and to reduce its scope.

Jumping straight in without asking questions first will be a red flag to the interviewer and will hinder your answer.

For instance, if you were asked, “What would be your 10-year strategy if you were CEO?” you can respond by asking some questions about the company’s current situation and any business objectives the interviewer may have in mind. This way, you’ll have a better understanding of what the company needs in the coming years and have more information from which to build a strategy.

4.4 Justify your choices

TikTok wants to see the reasoning behind your answer, so make sure to justify each decision you make. You'll need to make plenty of trade-offs as you arrive at a solution, so be sure to call them out.

4.5 Be data-driven, but not too data-driven

TikTok is looking for product managers who can make decisions based on data and can judge everything they do by relevant metrics.

In an interview situation, it's okay to make assumptions because you might not have access to the facts and data. But you need to make it clear that in real life, you would seek out that data and that your approach would be highly data-driven.

4.6 Demonstrate user empathy

TikTok wants product managers who can empathize with its users.

When answering a PM interview question, your first instinct should be to focus on the user. Identify who uses the product, why, and what the use cases are. Avoid designing a product based solely on personal preferences.

As part of your prep, think hard about the different kinds of users across TikTok’s ecosystem and be prepared to divide them into segments.

4.7 Check in with your interviewer

Interviewers differ in their willingness to provide hints. Some may wait for you to ask about customer or product details, while others expect you to make assumptions on your own.

Gauge this by asking a direct question or specifying your assumptions. If the interviewer tends to offer specifics, they’ll engage. If not, limit additional questions to demonstrate your ability to make decisions independently.

4.8 Answer methodically by using a framework

Like other tech companies, TikTok wants you to solve a problem methodically. You can use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework when answering behavioral questions.

We also recommend the SPSIL (Situation-Problem-Solution-Impact-Lessons) framework for leadership and behavioral questions, the BUS (Business Objective-User Problems-Solutions) framework for product sense questions, the GAME and DEC frameworks for product execution questions, and the CEC framework for technical questions.

4.9 Don’t get stuck in a framework

As we just said above, frameworks are extremely helpful. However, some of our successful candidates have mentioned that excessive reliance on frameworks may hinder your performance.

During the interview, trust your instinct, and don’t be afraid to deviate from the framework if needed. A framework is there to help you craft a better answer, not make you twist your answer to fit the framework. 

4.10 Treat the interview like a conversation

Keep in mind that the interview is a two-way discovery process. While the interviewer assesses if you’re a good fit for TikTok, you’re also evaluating if the company aligns with your aspirations and preferences.

4.11 Save questions and feedback for your interviewer

You’ll have a few minutes to ask your interviewer questions as the interview wraps up. Arriving without questions may suggest a lack of interest in the company or the role.

Prepare thoughtful questions that go beyond what you could have found out online. You can ask about career growth opportunities or specific ways of working in the company. It's your chance to showcase genuine curiosity and investment in the conversation.

5. Preparation Plan

We've coached more than 15,000 people for interviews since 2018. There are essentially three activities you can do to practice for interviews. Here’s what we've learned about each of them.

5.1 Learn by yourself

Learning by yourself is an essential first step. We recommend you make full use of the free prep resources on this blog and also watch some mock interviews on our product management YouTube channel. That way you can see what an excellent answer looks like.

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

5.2 Practice with peers

If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate
They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company
On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up

For those reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert. 

5.3 Practice with experienced PM interviewers

In our experience, practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.

Find a TikTok product manager interview coach so you can:

Test yourself under real interview conditions
Get accurate feedback from a real expert
Build your confidence
Get company-specific insights
Learn how to tell the right stories, better.
Save time by focusing your preparation

Landing a job at a big tech company often results in a $50,000 per year or more increase in total compensation. In our experience, three or four coaching sessions worth ~$500 make a significant difference in your ability to land the job. That’s an ROI of 100x!

1. What is the Meta analytical thinking interview?

First, let’s take a look at the analytical thinking interview’s place in the product management hiring process, and then we’ll dive into what it aims to assess you on.

The analytical thinking interview is one of three types of interviews you’ll face if you’re applying for a product manager role at Meta, the others being a “product sense” interview and a leadership & drive (behavioral) interview.

You will face analytical thinking questions both at the initial first-round stage (phone or video interview) and the onsite interview. You’ll be expected to lead the conversation, and you’ll need to sketch out your answer on a whiteboard or the online equivalent.

For a closer look at the PM interview process at Meta and more information on the two other types of interview rounds within it, take a look at our ultimate Meta product manager interview guide.

1.1 What does it test for?

As an ex-director of product outlines in this insider article on the Facebook PM interview, Meta often describes its product process as ""Understand, Identify, Execute.""

While the product sense round tests you on the first two parts of the process, the analytical thinking interview assesses you on the latter: how you execute solutions.

However, Meta comes at this not from a project management perspective (they already assume you can get tasks done) but from a data perspective. Your interviewer wants to see that you can use data to make the right decisions. This is why they re-named it from ""product execution"" to ""analytical thinking"".

The analytical thinking interview is therefore highly analytical, data-driven, and KPI-focused. As this helpful Meta interview prep guide outlines, your interviewer will be looking for four key things to see if your “analytical thinking” is up to Meta standards:

What does the Meta analytical thinking interview test for?

Goals: Being mindful of how the goals (especially quantitative goals) can be gamed or how they can sometimes be counter-indicative of progress.
Metrics: What would you use to measure if the product is healthy? Which one would you prioritize? What happens if one is decreasing and the other is increasing?
Debugging: Say you notice a specific metric dropping week after week. The interviewer will present a problem statement, and you should ask questions to describe how you’d approach this challenge and determine what’s causing this metric to drop.
Navigating a complex trade-off: “A” or “B” option—how do you know what to show to which communities of users?

Right, now that you know more context about what the analytical thinking interview is trying to test you on, let’s take a look at some questions. 

2. Meta analytical thinking/product execution interview questions

After analyzing the questions reported by PM candidates on Glassdoor, we can confirm that you’ll face questions that test you in the four areas listed above: goals, metrics, debugging and trade-offs. However, goal-setting questions and metric definition questions tend to be combined, so in reality, there are three types of questions you can expect to face in the interview:

Goal-setting and metric definition questions
Debugging questions 
Trade-off questions 

You should keep in mind that the interview will be very fluid, and one type of question will often merge into another, as would be the case in a real-life product management situation. For instance, most questions will eventually lead you to consider a trade-off of some description. 

Right, let’s take a look at some questions. These are all real examples of analytical thinking questions posed by Meta to PM candidates. We’ve simply changed the wording and grammar in some places to make them easier to understand. 

Meta analytical thinking/product execution interview question examples

Goal-setting and metric definition

You are a product manager for Netflix who has build a product for consuming podcasts. It launched 6 months ago. How do you measure success?
How would you set goals and success metrics for Meta Pay?
How would you set goals and measure success for Facebook Live?
How would you set goals and measure success for Facebook notifications?
How would you set goals and measure success for Instagram stories?
How would you determine the success of the blue check marks that denote verified users on Instagram?
How would you measure the success of Instagram stories?
How would you measure the success of a Roku (HD streaming) stick?
How would you measure the success of an app for creating meetings?

Debugging (metric change)

Amount of dollars sent using Meta Pay went down, why?

3. How to answer Meta analytical thinking questions

Now that we’ve seen examples of the questions you’re likely to face, let’s dive into how best to answer them.

3.1 Goal-setting and metric definition questions

These are questions like “If you’re the product manager for Facebook Sponsored Posts, define the goals and metrics.”

Here, the focus is on your ability to define metrics that provide clarity on the health of a product or feature. There are many different metrics you could be tracking, (e.g. impressions, clicks, return on ad spend, etc.) and your interviewer will want to hear you select the most important ones using a rigorous process.

We recommend the GAME method to structure your approach to these questions. The four steps are:

Goals

Actions

Metrics

Evaluations

Study our full explanation of how you can use the GAME method to ace goal-setting and metric definition questions.

3.2 Debugging questions

These are questions like “A Meta product shows a 10% drop in newly registered users: what data would you need to understand and fix the problem?”

These questions that Meta calls “debugging” are sometimes referred to as ""root cause"" or ""diagnosis"" questions, but we call them “metric change"" questions. They test if you know what to do when a key product metric (e.g. traffic, revenue, engagement, etc.) is going up or down for no apparent reason. There are many different reasons why this change might be happening, and your interviewer will want to see you take a bulletproof approach to find the root cause of the issue.

Here at IGotAnOffer, we've developed our own method to help you give a clear and thorough answer to debugging/metric change questions. The three steps are:

Define the metric change

Explore possible root causes of the change

Conclude

This method is easy to use and helps you to avoid a huge pitfall that many candidates walk into straight away. Learn it in full here, below our explanation of the GAME method (simply scroll down to section 2.2)

3.3. Trade-off questions

These are questions such as “How would you evaluate a trade-off between boosting ad revenue and decreasing retention?”

These questions are often referred to as prioritization questions. They test whether you can make difficult prioritization and trade-off decisions in pursuit of goals, then adapt plans as the team executes. 

To structure your answers, we recommend using the RICE framework.

Reach

Impact

Confidence

Effort

4. How to practice analytical thinking & execution questions

We've coached more than 15,000 people for interviews since 2018. There are essentially three activities you can do to practice for interviews. Here’s what we've learned about each of them.

4.1 Learn by yourself

Learning by yourself is an essential first step. We recommend you make full use of the free prep resources on this blog and also watch some mock interviews on our product management YouTube channel. That way you can see what an excellent answer looks like.

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

4.2 Practice with peers

If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate
They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company
On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up

For those reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert. 

4.3 Practice with experienced PM interviewers

In our experience, practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.

Find a Meta product manager interview coach so you can::

Test yourself under real interview conditions
Get accurate feedback from a real expert
Build your confidence
Get company-specific insights
Learn how to tell the right stories, better.
Save time by focusing your preparation

Landing a job at a big tech company often results in a $50,000 per year or more increase in total compensation. In our experience, three or four coaching sessions worth ~$500 make a significant difference in your ability to land the job. That’s an ROI of 100x!

1. What is a product metrics interview question? ↑

Metric interview questions test if candidates can perform data analysis and select key metrics that matter most to the success of a product. 

Employers like Meta and Google use these questions to evaluate analytical thinking and communication skills. 

There are two types of metric questions: metric definition questions and metric change questions.

Metric definition questions focus on your ability to define metrics that provide clarity on the health of a product or feature. Here’s an example question: “What metrics would you use to determine success for Facebook Sponsored Posts?” 

There are many different metrics you could be tracking (e.g. impressions, clicks, return on ad spend, etc.) and your interviewer will want to hear you select the most important ones using a rigorous process.

Metric change questions test if you know what to do when a key product metric (e.g. traffic, revenue, engagement, etc.) is going up or down for no apparent reason. For example, “Facebook’s Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to your superior?” 

There are many different reasons why this decrease might be happening and your interviewer will want to see you take a bulletproof approach to find the root-cause of the issue.

2. How to answer metrics interview questions ↑

A common mistake candidates make when answering metric questions is to provide an unstructured answer. It’s very important for you to be prepared in demonstrating your analytical thinking and communication skills.

The key thing is to show data-driven decision-making. Mark, a former Meta and Google senior product manager, advises, “Be prepared to answer questions that require data interpretation and making data-driven decisions. Familiarize yourself with basic metrics for product success and have a few methodologies in mind for tackling growth, engagement, and scalability issues.""

Mark adds, ""You should be schooled on all the activation metrics - adoption, engagement, quality...etc. - there are dozens of metrics in there and you need to be solid on them all. Often I think people don't think enough about retention and especially at Meta, that's a huge metric and it's becoming more important at different companies too.""

Dessy, a former Amazon senior product manager, shares, “Imagine a funnel in your mind by following that user journey, and have 1-2 metrics for each user step. This ensures you think through the metrics systematically and not randomly. Tie it back to overall company strategy and goals, link it back on how the product metrics will contribute to the overall company’s North Star metrics.”

In addition, Dessy says, “Always consider all sides, for example, in an eCommerce business, consider different metrics set for each type of users: Buyers (new buyers, active users, spent per user etc), Sellers (active sellers, active listings, etc.) and the Company itself (e.g. revenue, profitability). For ads, the different users would be: Users, Advertisers/Brands, Influencers, and the Company itself.  Also, walk through your entire thinking process with your interviewer; think out loud.”

In this next section, we’ll walk through two step-by-step approaches you can use to avoid that pitfall — one for metric definition questions and one for metric change questions.

2.1 Metric definition questions: GAME method

Metric definition question example

“What metrics would you use to determine success for Facebook Feed?”

Our recommendation is to use the GAME method to answer metric definition questions. Let’s walk through each of the four steps one by one:

Goals
Actions
Metrics
Evaluations

1. Goals: First, you should start by making sure you understand the product properly and agree with your interviewer on specific user and business objectives. 

Agreeing on the goals upfront is extremely important because what you measure will change entirely depending on what you’re trying to achieve with the product.

For instance, imagine your interviewer has asked you, “What metrics would you use to measure the success of Meta’s Facebook Feed?” The Feed is one of Facebook’s main features and it fulfills many objectives for the business. 

It’s a primary driver of user engagement, a strong revenue generator, and the main place where Facebook can test new personalization features. So, how do you determine what the most important objective is?

There’s no single right answer to this question but you could begin by saying, ""My understanding is that there are several use cases for the Feed including engaging users, generating ad revenue, and testing new personalization features. To stay healthy, Facebook needs strong user engagement, so I would assume that this is the primary business goal. Is that what you have in mind, too?""

2. Actions: Next, you should think about all the actions users can take in the product. Listing each action will help you focus on available metrics and avoid those that aren’t trackable.

The easiest way to do this is to think about what it really means for a user to be “engaged.” You should aim to list every relevant action (e.g. creating a post, viewing a post, commenting, liking, sharing, etc.). 

However, it’s also a good idea to avoid going into too much detail. For example, simply list “liking” as a category of action instead of “liking a friend’s post, liking a group’s post, liking an event, liking a comment, etc.”

Next, you need to prioritize your list of actions. Remember to use the goals you established in the previous step to explain your thinking. 

For instance, you might say something like, “There are a number of user actions which reflect engagement but I think the three most important ones are likely to be posting, commenting, and sharing.”

3. Metrics: Once you have a prioritized list of actions, it’s time to define associated metrics for each one. In this step it’s important that you define the metrics you will measure with precision.

Let’s imagine that in our previous step, after discussing with your interviewer, you prioritized the “comment” and “share” actions. Talking about “comments” and “shares” isn’t sufficient as there are many different ways in which you can track these actions.

In order to measure engagement based on these actions, here are some metrics that would make sense to track:

""Comment"" metrics
Comments per thousand sessions
Comments per thousand posts seen
Comments per thousand posts clicked
""Share"" metrics
Shares per thousand sessions
Shares per thousand posts seen
Shares per thousand posts clicked

4. Evaluations: After defining metrics, you should conclude the discussion by answering the initial question with the metrics you recommend. Finally, evaluate the metrics you have selected by highlighting trade-offs and limitations.

For the Facebook Feed example, you could summarize by saying something like, “So, in order to increase Feed engagement, I would first look at comments and shares per thousand sessions. These metrics would give us an idea of meaningful engagement for the average user.”

The last key step is to show that you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your recommended metrics.

So you could wrap up your answer by saying something like:

“We should keep in mind that not all commenting and sharing is positive. Perhaps we should monitor the sentiment of these actions to make sure we're creating a positive experience overall. Also, commenting and sharing represent deep engagement. If we are interested in shallower engagement we might need to consider other metrics (e.g. number of sessions per user per day, number of likes per user, etc.) to measure engagement for users who don't comment or share but still use the product frequently.”

2.2 Metric change questions: IGotAnOffer method

Metric change question example

“Facebook Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to the your superior?”

We developed the IGotAnOffer method below to help you give a clear and thorough answer to metric change questions. Let’s walk through each of the three steps one by one:

Define the metric change.
Explore possible root-causes of the change.
Conclude.

1. Define the metric change: Many candidates skip this step and start listing ideas in an unstructured way. This is a big red flag for interviewers. Before starting to answer the question you need to define the metric change in detail. This often entails asking for three pieces of information:

The exact definition of the metric we’re talking about
The time period over which the metric has changed
The characteristics of the user segment impacted by the change (e.g. device type, country, etc.)

Let’s imagine your interviewer asks, “Facebook Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to the CEO?” 

To clarify your understanding, you might then ask something like, “What exactly do we mean by engagement here? Is that a direct measurement like number of sessions, or a combination of more detailed metrics (e.g. likes + comments + shares per user, etc.)? And over what time period has that change occurred? Finally, do we know if all users are impacted or only a particular segment?”

Here let’s imagine your interviewer tells you that the number of Feed sessions for all users has gone down 10% since yesterday. 

Only after you’ve clarified this information should you start exploring possible root-causes.

2. Explore possible root-causes: Interviewers want to see that you’re thinking of every possible problem which could cause the metric change you are investigating. 

In order to ensure you’re thinking comprehensively and communicating clearly, you should:

Create a MECE framework for possible root-causes.
Brainstorm potential root-causes to the problem within this framework.
Discuss the different root-causes identified with interviewer.

For our drop in engagement example, you could split your investigation between internal and external factors:

Internal factors: possible problems internal to Facebook that can explain the drop in sessions
External factors: possible problems external to Facebook that can explain the drop in sessions

Note that the framework above is MECE or Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. The root-cause of the problem has to be internal OR external, as there is no other option.

Once you’ve created your framework you need to brainstorm ideas and possible causes within each of the areas you identified. For example here you could populate your framework with the following points:

Internal factors:
Data accuracy (e.g. This metric change was measured incorrectly)
We broke the product (e.g. Someone in the organization made a change that broke the Newsfeed)
We made the product worse (e.g. The quality of content in the Feed has degraded)
other internal factors
External factors:
User habits (e.g. User changed habits overnight for some reason, like a protest)
Referrers (e.g. Google had an outage)
Competition (e.g. TikTok released a new feature that captured a portion of our normal Feed traffic)
other external factors

The interviewer will most likely stop you to talk about some of your proposed root-causes, which is perfectly normal. Listen carefully to what they say, as they will often provide clues that will point you in the right direction.

3. Conclude: Finally, you should conclude by summarizing your findings related to the initial question you were asked.

Let’s imagine that you discovered Facebook suffered an outage which caused the drop in sessions. In this case you might summarize by saying something like, “Based on what we’ve talked about, I would explain to the CEO that Newsfeed sessions dropped 10% since yesterday because of a major outage this morning. I would also make it clear that we came to this conclusion by ensuring it could not be any other cause, and double-checked that the duration of the outage aligns with the 10% drop.”

3. Example metrics questions with answers ↑

Now that you know how to approach metric questions, let's look at some full examples.

3.1 YouTube traffic went down 5% — how would you report this issue to the executive team?

This is a metric change question, so we’ll use the IGotAnOffer method described above.

Step one: Define the metric change

First we want to completely understand the question and define the metric, as “traffic” is a bit vague. 

Here are some questions that immediately come to mind and will help confirm our understanding:

What exactly do we mean by traffic here? Website visits, or plays on videos, or time spent watching? etc.
Is this impacting all user segments? Or maybe only a particular device type, or country, or browser? etc.
When did the dip start and how long did it last?

For the rest of this example let’s imagine the interviewer tells us that the average time spent watching per session is down 5% month-over-month worldwide on mobile only.

Step two: Explore possible root-causes

Now that we know the exact problem we can create a framework to identify the root-cause of the time spent watching per session decrease:

Internal factors: possible problems internal to YouTube that can explain the drop in average time spent watching per session
External factors: possible problems external to YouTube that can explain the drop in average time spent watching per session

Within this Internal / External framework, let’s brainstorm different root-causes that could drive down the average time spent watching per session:

Internal factors:
Data accuracy (e.g. We should confirm our reporting tool is working as expected)
Context (e.g. This could be an expected seasonal drop)
Access to the product (e.g. We might have had a major outage)
Product changes (e.g. We could have shipped some code that introduced a bug)
Product quality (e.g. Recent content might have been bad enough to drive away traffic)
External factors:
User habits (e.g. Video consumption is down across the industry)
Referrers (e.g. Facebook made a change to limit linking to YouTube videos)
Competition (e.g. Instagram TV released a new feature that captured our users)
Society (e.g. There’s less active users because of civil unrest in a country that typically drives a lot of traffic)

We can also dive deeper on some of the root causes. Here’s an example of how the conversation could go.

Data accuracy: Have we checked this dip compared to a similar metric — for example, time on page? Is there anything else indicating that our reporting tool might be broken?

Let’s imagine the interviewer confirms that we’re seeing a similar dip with time on page that leads us to believe the data is accurate. They also confirm that we’ve double-checked that our reporting is working as expected.

Context: Is there any history of a similar dip? We’re close to major holidays, perhaps that could lead to less product usage overall.

The interviewer lets us know the only time we’ve seen a drop of more than 1% this time of year was due to major outages, but we have had 100% uptime in the past few months. This information also addresses our next factor, as access to the product hasn’t been disrupted.

Product changes: Is it possible we shipped some code that introduced a bug? Or, did we release any significant feature changes?

Let’s imagine the interviewer says that the user interface for the video player was recently changed on mobile. We would then ask questions to explore this such as, “What exactly was changed in the UI and was any drop to be expected as a result?”

After discussing with the interviewer, we learn that the UI change involved making the “Send video to device” button two times larger, and reducing the “Full screen” button by half its original size. The interviewer also explains that the “Send video to device” button can be used to play a video that’s on your mobile phone on another device such as a Chromecast, Roku, SmartTV, etc.

This is interesting, but we need to investigate further. At this point, we could form a hypothesis and say something like, “Have we noticed a change in the frequency at which the ‘Send video to device’ and ‘Full screen’ buttons are being used on mobile? Maybe mobile users are having a harder time tapping the ‘Full screen’ button now that it’s smaller, and are tapping the ‘Send video to device’ button by accident because it’s too big? Tapping ‘Send video to device’ would end the session and therefore decrease the average time per session. And if the smaller ‘Full screen’ button is harder to tap, it might frustrate some users and lead them to end their session early.”

Let’s imagine that the interviewer confirms that this is likely one of the drivers of the decrease. Before making any final conclusion, we would continue exploring the remaining elements (i.e. product quality and external factors) to confirm that they aren’t also a driver of the change we are observing. Let’s imagine we quickly discuss this with our interviewer, and they confirm there’s nothing significant to report related to those remaining possible factors.

Step three: Discuss and conclude

Now that we’ve stepped through our framework, we would conclude by saying something like, “Based on what we’ve talked about, I would explain to the executive team that our time spent watching per session has dropped by 5% month-over-month on mobile because of a change in the video player UI, which has negatively affected the user experience. Mobile users are having a hard time tapping the new, smaller ‘Full screen’ button and are ending their session prematurely. They are also now more often tapping the larger ‘Send video to device’ button unintentionally which also ends their session early.”

Finally, we could enrich our answer by saying something such as, “We’ve also double-checked that no other drivers were causing this engagement dip. A good next step here would probably be to revert the UI changes, think through why we made these changes in the first place, and brainstorm how we can achieve the goals we were aiming for in a different way.”

But before we get into each step, let's get to know Amazon first.

About Amazon

Amazon was founded in 1994 as an online marketplace selling books. It has since expanded into a multinational company with e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming as some of its top products. 

Amazon is currently valued at $1.954 billion as a public company. It currently employs over 1.5 million people worldwide, with office locations in every part of the world. The majority of these employees are US employees. This makes Amazon the second-largest private employer and the largest job creator in the country.

As expected from one of the world’s top tech companies, Amazon is incredibly hard to get into. But, don’t let that intimidate you. According to AboutAmazon.com senior editor, Alexis Loinaz, “Amazon goes to great lengths to support interviewees by eliminating any ambiguity from the interview process.” You’ll see this demonstrated in Amazon’s detailed interviewing page where you’ll find guides for some of the company’s roles. Also, once you get an interview, you’ll have a dedicated recruiter who’ll be with you every step of the process.

Working at Amazon↑

Here are a few things about working at Amazon that make it unique from other top tech companies.

Customer obsession

This is obvious from reading Amazon’s mission statement (""Our mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company”) and its first Leadership Principle (Customer obsession). 

No matter what role you’re in, whether you’re a software development engineer, a product manager, or an account executive at Amazon, the customer-centric approach is expected to be central to all your initiatives. 

Document culture

One of the most unique aspects of working at Amazon is its writing culture. Every meeting starts with a document, which attendees read for the first 20 minutes. They then spend the rest of the scheduled meeting analyzing the document and giving feedback. Afterwards, the document writer revises it before distributing it in its final form.

This is why you’ll find that several roles will require a writing assessment as part of the application process.

Top-down decision-making

Unlike Meta and Google, Amazon follows a top-down decision-making process, giving the executive team a relatively high degree of control. 

The company does give its function-based teams and regional groups some room to experiment and innovate to help the global company address the rapidly changing needs of customers. As ex-Amazon interviewer Dessy explained to us, teams at Amazon operate relatively independently, almost like their own start-ups. 

Great salaries

Of course, the excellent salaries on offer are likely part of your reason for applying to work at Amazon. How do Amazon's salaries compare to those of other FAANG companies? Here’s a comparison table featuring the average salaries and compensation for software engineer, product manager, and engineering manager roles.

Now let’s get into the Amazon recruitment process.

Step 1: Resume screen↑

First, you’ll need to convince recruiters that you have a strong enough profile to be invited to the first round of Amazon interviews. Here, you will either submit your application through Amazon’s jobs portal, or you will have been contacted directly via email or LinkedIn by an Amazon recruiter.

In either case, you will need a strong resume to impress them.

This is an extremely competitive step, as we’ve found that ~90% of candidates don’t make it past the resume stage. To help you put together a targeted resume that stands out from the crowd, follow the tips below.

Tips on crafting a resume
Study the job description: The work experience that you display on your resume should relate directly to the role qualifications that you’re applying for. Incorporating job-specific keywords also helps you pass the applicant tracking system (ATS).
Be specific: Use data to back up your claims. How many people were on the team that you managed? How were your successes measured? Quantify your achievements as much as you can.
Emphasize leadership: As much as you can, highlight roles and positions where you displayed some of Amazon’s Leadership Principles, but only if applicable.
Keep it simple and concise: Make your resume as reader-friendly as possible. Stick to black-and-white and don't use decorative fonts. Focus on your achievements instead of filling up your resume with your responsibilities in your previous roles.

The tips above include abbreviated information from our tech resume guides. For more detailed steps as well as examples to follow, take a look at one of our articles below:

However, if you want personalized feedback and tips from those who know Amazon’s hiring process firsthand, you may want to book a resume review service with one of our Amazon coaches.

Step 2: Recruiter call↑

You’ll likely receive an email from your recruiter if you pass the resume screening stage. You might also get a call, during which they will discuss with you how the overall interview process will work. If you have any specific questions (e.g. timeline, location, clarification about the job description), now is the time to ask. 

Usually, this call won’t include technical questions, although candidates for some highly technical roles like software engineers may receive a few low-level screening questions that test general technical knowledge. 

Otherwise, you can expect your recruiter to ask typical behavioral and resume questions like “Why Amazon?”, “Walk me through your resume,” and “Tell me about yourself.” 

Overall, Amazon interviews put a bigger emphasis on behavioral interview questions compared to other companies like Meta or Google. This is because the company is looking for candidates who align with their 16 Leadership Principles.

If you’re going to ace the rest of Amazon’s interview process, you need to be well-acquainted with these principles. Let’s take a look at them in more detail below.

Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles 
Customer Obsession: ""Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.”
Ownership: ""Leaders are owners. They think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say ‘that’s not my job.’”
Invent and Simplify: ""Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by ‘not invented here.’ Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.”
Are Right, A Lot: ""Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.”
Learn and Be Curious: ""Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.”
Hire and Develop the Best: ""Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.”
Insist on the Highest Standards: ""Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.”
Think Big: ""Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.”
Bias for Action: ""Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.”
Frugality: ""Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.”
Earn Trust: “Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.”
Dive Deep: ""Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.”
Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit: ""Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”
Deliver Results: ""Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.”
Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer: “Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.”
Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility: “We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.”

Step 3: Assessments↑

The process and content of the assessment section differ from role to role. Sometimes you’ll get it during the resume submission stage, and sometimes the recruiter will send it after you send in your resume. 

The number and type of assessment you’ll get may also differ depending on the role you’re up for. There are two general categories of Amazon assessments: work sample simulations and work-style assessments/surveys. Your recruiter email will indicate which of these assessments you’ll be getting.

Let’s take a closer look.

3.1 Work sample simulation/assessment

The work sample simulation is a sort of “day in the life” type of activity or simulation video game. Your prompts may come in the form of emails, videos, or instant messages from a virtual manager or team member. You’ll also receive materials to inform your decision. You’ll be tested on your problem-solving skills in alignment with Amazon’s Leadership Principles. 

According to Amazon’s official description of this simulation: “Depending on the role you are applying for, the assessment may ask you to interpret data from a chart, answer a customer question, choose how to resolve an issue, multitask, or find the right information from multiple sources.”

Some roles will require technical or written assessments on top of a work sample simulation. Candidates for engineering roles such as software development engineer and front-end engineer will receive a 90-minute coding challenge followed by a 20-minute system design assessment.

Candidates for roles such as product manager, technical program manager, and software development manager will receive a writing assessment. This writing assessment may be given after the technical phone screen (which we’ll cover below). It must be submitted two days before the interview loop, as interviewers may refer to it during the interview.

Prepare for the written assessment requirement by reading this article. It gives a great overview of Amazon's written document format.

3.2 Work-style assessment/survey

Amazon work-style assessments/surveys are shorter tests that ask a range of behavioral questions in order to get an idea of how well your work style will fit in with Amazon’s culture.

Take a look at Amazon’s own description of this assessment: “[They] are centered around Amazon’s peculiar culture and Leadership Principles, and typically take 10-20 minutes to complete. In these assessments, we ask you to choose the extent to which a statement represents your work style. For instance, we may ask you which of the two statements ""I like for things to be clearly structured,” or “I look forward to the opportunity to learn new things,"" best describes you.”

This assessment is frequently assigned at the end of a longer work sample simulation, as extra data for the interviewers to consider

Step 4: Phone screen(s)↑

Next, you will have one or two phone screens with a hiring manager and/or future peers. In most cases, these will be video calls using Amazon Chime, although some interviewers may opt to keep their cameras turned off.

At this point, interviewers will dig deeper into your past experience with behavioral and hypothetical questions that test specific skills related to the role.

Technical roles will also include coding on a shared code editor or word document. In most cases, it will not include syntax highlight or auto-completion, so prepare for that kind of coding environment in advance. To learn more, review our guide to Amazon coding interview questions.

Based on the official guides on Amazon’s career page, the phone screens typically last for 60 minutes. You can expect to cover both role-related and behavioral questions. Here’s a summary of the topics for the phone screens per role:

Software development engineer:  Amazon LP questions, coding and system design questions
Software development manager: Amazon LP questions, system design questions on new or existing designs
Business intelligence engineer: Amazon LP questions, SQL writing, technical questions (data warehousing, analysis, security, coding, statistics, etc.)
Product manager - technical: Amazon LP questions, technical product life cycle questions
Product manager: Amazon LP questions, questions on product management experience
Front-end engineer: Amazon LP questions, front-end coding challenge
Technical program manager: Amazon LP questions, questions on project management experience

Ultimately, if you’re prepared for the types of in-depth questions you’ll receive at the interview loop stage, then you’ll be prepared for the initial phone screens.

Step 5: Interview loop↑

The longest and most intimidating step of the Amazon interview process is the final interview loop. It may be onsite at one of Amazon’s offices, or virtual via Amazon Chime.

While you can expect interviews at Amazon to be challenging, Amazon/AWS interview coach Sergey says that its interview process is standard for FAANG companies. The biggest distinction is that it places a big focus on the Leadership Principles.

During the interview loop, you will have four to five interview rounds that last 45-60 minutes each, led by a mix of interviewers that may include your hiring manager, members of the team you’re applying to, senior management, and the Bar Raiser. 

Below is a sample interview loop schedule you might get if you apply for the SDE role.

Bar Raisers are not associated with the team you’re applying to. They focus more on overall candidate quality than specific team needs. They get special training to make sure Amazon’s hiring standards stay high and don’t degrade over time, so they are a big barrier between you and the job offer. 

We’ll talk more about the Bar Raiser in Step 6. To learn more about this unique interviewer role, you can read our complete guide to Bar Raiser interviews.

If you’ve been asked to interview onsite and are required to travel, you don’t need to worry about this. Amazon can help arrange all the logistical details for you, including any special accommodations you may require.

If your interview is remote, you’ll need to download Amazon Chime for video conferencing. Make sure to download the app on your desktop computer if you’ll be presenting during your interview.

After the interview loop, you can expect to hear back from your recruiter within five business days according to Amazon’s 2&5 Promise. This assures candidates that they will hear from Amazon within two business days after a phone interview (or series of interviews) and within five business days after the interview loop.

To help you prepare for your Amazon interviews, we have created in-depth guides to the interviews for top Amazon roles. There you’ll find a breakdown of the interview loop specific to the roles you’re applying for, plus some example questions we’ve gathered from real candidate reports on Glassdoor.

We highly recommend putting a special focus on Leadership Principles during your interview practice. Get started by reading our Amazon Leadership Principles guide. We also recommend watching and doing plenty of mock interviews. Check out the video below where ex-Amazon PM interviewer Jason answers some very common Amazon LP questions.

 
Amazon interview experiences

Based on Glassdoor interview reviews, 60% of candidates consider their Amazon interviews a positive experience, a bit worse than Apple and Google interviews but slightly better than Meta and Netflix interviews.

Those who rated the interviews positively noted that the interviews were straightforward, relaxed, and professionally handled. Some mentioned working directly with great recruiters throughout the process.

Those who rated the interviews badly noted how long the entire process took. Most described the length of the interview loops as too exhaustive and unnecessarily long. Others reported having difficulty getting interview schedules, stretching the duration of their application.

Regarding the interview questions, candidates said that they were fairly standard for the roles and nothing out of the ordinary was asked. Many mentioned how particular the interviewers were about behavioral questions, specifically about using the STAR method when structuring answers.

Step 6: Interviewer debrief / hiring committee↑

After your interview loop, your interviewers will come together to compare notes on your performance during the interviewer debrief.

Each interviewer will have written a summary of their experience with you, including the questions and your answers, as well as a final recommendation (e.g. Strong hire, hire, leaning hire, strong no hire, no hire, leaning no hire, etc.). They will review this during the debrief, along with your resume, your assessments, and any input from your screening rounds. 

The Bar Raiser is in charge of leading this meeting and is the ultimate decision-maker. They have the ability to unilaterally veto the interviewers’ and hiring manager’s decisions. However, this rarely happens. Instead, the Bar Raiser and hiring manager typically strive to drive consensus and come to a collaborative final decision.

Once the committee comes to a hire or no-hire decision, the recruiter will communicate the decision with you. However, sometimes the committee may decide they need more information about a specific competency. In this case, they will schedule one to two more interview rounds for you to complete, then reconvene to make a decision.

Team matching

In many cases, candidates interview for a specific team from the beginning of the interview process, and the final offer from the interviewer debrief comes with a team already matched to the candidate.

In other cases, candidates go through a separate team matching process after the interviewer debrief. This typically happens if the Bar Raiser or committee as a whole decides that you meet the hiring bar, but are not a good fit for the team you have originally interviewed for. 

Here, your recruiter will pass your information to other teams within Amazon, keeping you updated in the process. For the best outcome, it helps to be proactive and take a look at other open positions, sending the teams that interest you to your recruiter for reference.

Reports vary as to how long this process may take, with some candidates reporting a new team match and written offer within a week, and others taking months.

Step 7: Salary negotiation↑

Finally, once you’ve passed each of the six steps above, you’ll receive your offer package from Amazon.

At this point, all that is left for you to do is negotiate your offer. Your recruiter will get in touch with you about the details, likely scheduling one final call to clarify and discuss the terms. If they have not scheduled a call, you can ask for one.

Of course, salary discussions can be difficult and a bit uncomfortable, especially if you are not used to them. Below are some tips to help you navigate your salary negotiations. You can also check out our Amazon job offer negotiation guide and get salary negotiation coaching from ex-Amazon recruiters to help you maximize your compensation.

Salary negotiation tips:
Be polite: Remember that the person you’re negotiating with is just doing their job, and that the two of you are not enemies. You’ll get much farther in your negotiations if you approach the conversation with grace.
Don’t give a number right away: Whenever possible, it’s better to wait until you receive an offer to start negotiating. This reduces the risk of giving a number that is lower than what the company otherwise would have paid, or giving a number that is so high that they are reluctant to interview you.
Do your research: Have a number in mind before the conversation begins, and back it up with data. Research your position and level on Levels.fyi, ask around on professional social networking sites like Blind, factor in the cost of living where you are, and, ideally, get some input from a current Amazon employee.
Start high: To start the conversation, name a compensation number that is higher than your goal, and the Amazon negotiator will likely end up negotiating it down to a number that is closer to your original goal.
Negotiate everything: Your offer will include more than a base salary and stock options—you also have bonuses, vacation days, location, work from home, and other aspects to consider. If the salary won’t budge, there may be some wiggle room around the other perks.

Once you’ve completed this step and accepted your offer: congratulations! It’s time to start your career at Amazon.

1. What is a product metrics interview question? ↑

Metric interview questions test if candidates can perform data analysis and select key metrics that matter most to the success of a product. 

Employers like Meta and Google use these questions to evaluate analytical thinking and communication skills. 

There are two types of metric questions: metric definition questions and metric change questions.

Metric definition questions focus on your ability to define metrics that provide clarity on the health of a product or feature. Here’s an example question: “What metrics would you use to determine success for Facebook Sponsored Posts?” 

There are many different metrics you could be tracking (e.g. impressions, clicks, return on ad spend, etc.) and your interviewer will want to hear you select the most important ones using a rigorous process.

Metric change questions test if you know what to do when a key product metric (e.g. traffic, revenue, engagement, etc.) is going up or down for no apparent reason. For example, “Facebook’s Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to your superior?” 

There are many different reasons why this decrease might be happening and your interviewer will want to see you take a bulletproof approach to find the root-cause of the issue.

2. How to answer metrics interview questions ↑

A common mistake candidates make when answering metric questions is to provide an unstructured answer. It’s very important for you to be prepared in demonstrating your analytical thinking and communication skills.

The key thing is to show data-driven decision-making. Mark, a former Meta and Google senior product manager, advises, “Be prepared to answer questions that require data interpretation and making data-driven decisions. Familiarize yourself with basic metrics for product success and have a few methodologies in mind for tackling growth, engagement, and scalability issues.""

Mark adds, ""You should be schooled on all the activation metrics - adoption, engagement, quality...etc. - there are dozens of metrics in there and you need to be solid on them all. Often I think people don't think enough about retention and especially at Meta, that's a huge metric and it's becoming more important at different companies too.""

Dessy, a former Amazon senior product manager, shares, “Imagine a funnel in your mind by following that user journey, and have 1-2 metrics for each user step. This ensures you think through the metrics systematically and not randomly. Tie it back to overall company strategy and goals, link it back on how the product metrics will contribute to the overall company’s North Star metrics.”

In addition, Dessy says, “Always consider all sides, for example, in an eCommerce business, consider different metrics set for each type of users: Buyers (new buyers, active users, spent per user etc), Sellers (active sellers, active listings, etc.) and the Company itself (e.g. revenue, profitability). For ads, the different users would be: Users, Advertisers/Brands, Influencers, and the Company itself.  Also, walk through your entire thinking process with your interviewer; think out loud.”

Khalid, a former Facebook, Twitter, and DoorDash product manager, explains, ""All metrics have downsides, the aim isn’t to find a perfect metric, but a good enough metric that encapsulates the business/user goal while being aware of what its potential downside or error is.

""So, contextualize the 100% performance of a metric. Meaning, if you are building a payroll processing app, you can’t expect people to login daily, this isn’t the natural bar of success given that payroll processing is usually a biweekly habit, with some logins in between for handling some issues. Have an idea of where you 0 and 100% boundaries for a metric are to understand where you are progress wise.""

Khalid adds, ""Metrics have depth and correlation, differentiate between input and output metrics as for any one problem there is a spectrum of zooming in and out to pick the right metric. e.g if you’re running an ads team that focuses on improving the ads interfaces and your growl is increasing revenue, revenue is one metric, likely reported as a result metric to leadership, but there are many input metrics into that (e.g number of advertisers, ad spending per advertiser…etc) so to focus your time, 'advertiser growth' can be a better metric than just “revenue increase”, unless you are intentionally trying to cast a wide net in order to for example.""

In the next section, we’ll walk through two step-by-step approaches you can use to avoid that pitfall of an unstructured answer. We divide the approaches into two — one for metric definition questions and one for metric change questions.

2.1 Metric definition questions: GAME method

Metric definition question example

“What metrics would you use to determine success for Facebook Feed?”

Our recommendation is to use the GAME method to answer metric definition questions. Let’s walk through each of the four steps one by one:

Goals
Actions
Metrics
Evaluations

1. Goals: First, you should start by making sure you understand the product properly and agree with your interviewer on specific user and business objectives. 

Agreeing on the goals upfront is extremely important because what you measure will change entirely depending on what you’re trying to achieve with the product.

For instance, imagine your interviewer has asked you, “What metrics would you use to measure the success of Meta’s Facebook Feed?” The Feed is one of Facebook’s main features and it fulfills many objectives for the business. 

It’s a primary driver of user engagement, a strong revenue generator, and the main place where Facebook can test new personalization features. So, how do you determine what the most important objective is?

There’s no single right answer to this question but you could begin by saying, ""My understanding is that there are several use cases for the Feed including engaging users, generating ad revenue, and testing new personalization features. To stay healthy, Facebook needs strong user engagement, so I would assume that this is the primary business goal. Is that what you have in mind, too?""

2. Actions: Next, you should think about all the actions users can take in the product. Listing each action will help you focus on available metrics and avoid those that aren’t trackable.

The easiest way to do this is to think about what it really means for a user to be “engaged.” You should aim to list every relevant action (e.g. creating a post, viewing a post, commenting, liking, sharing, etc.). 

However, it’s also a good idea to avoid going into too much detail. For example, simply list “liking” as a category of action instead of “liking a friend’s post, liking a group’s post, liking an event, liking a comment, etc.”

Next, you need to prioritize your list of actions. Remember to use the goals you established in the previous step to explain your thinking. 

For instance, you might say something like, “There are a number of user actions which reflect engagement but I think the three most important ones are likely to be posting, commenting, and sharing.”

3. Metrics: Once you have a prioritized list of actions, it’s time to define associated metrics for each one. In this step it’s important that you define the metrics you will measure with precision.

Let’s imagine that in our previous step, after discussing with your interviewer, you prioritized the “comment” and “share” actions. Talking about “comments” and “shares” isn’t sufficient as there are many different ways in which you can track these actions.

In order to measure engagement based on these actions, here are some metrics that would make sense to track:

""Comment"" metrics
Comments per thousand sessions
Comments per thousand posts seen
Comments per thousand posts clicked
""Share"" metrics
Shares per thousand sessions
Shares per thousand posts seen
Shares per thousand posts clicked

4. Evaluations: After defining metrics, you should conclude the discussion by answering the initial question with the metrics you recommend. Finally, evaluate the metrics you have selected by highlighting trade-offs and limitations.

For the Facebook Feed example, you could summarize by saying something like, “So, in order to increase Feed engagement, I would first look at comments and shares per thousand sessions. These metrics would give us an idea of meaningful engagement for the average user.”

The last key step is to show that you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your recommended metrics.

So you could wrap up your answer by saying something like:

“We should keep in mind that not all commenting and sharing is positive. Perhaps we should monitor the sentiment of these actions to make sure we're creating a positive experience overall. Also, commenting and sharing represent deep engagement. If we are interested in shallower engagement we might need to consider other metrics (e.g. number of sessions per user per day, number of likes per user, etc.) to measure engagement for users who don't comment or share but still use the product frequently.”

2.2 Metric change questions: IGotAnOffer method

Metric change question example

“Facebook Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to the your superior?”

We developed the IGotAnOffer method below to help you give a clear and thorough answer to metric change questions. Let’s walk through each of the three steps one by one:

Define the metric change.
Explore possible root-causes of the change.
Conclude.

1. Define the metric change: Many candidates skip this step and start listing ideas in an unstructured way. This is a big red flag for interviewers. Before starting to answer the question you need to define the metric change in detail. This often entails asking for three pieces of information:

The exact definition of the metric we’re talking about
The time period over which the metric has changed
The characteristics of the user segment impacted by the change (e.g. device type, country, etc.)

Let’s imagine your interviewer asks, “Facebook Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to the CEO?” 

To clarify your understanding, you might then ask something like, “What exactly do we mean by engagement here? Is that a direct measurement like number of sessions, or a combination of more detailed metrics (e.g. likes + comments + shares per user, etc.)? And over what time period has that change occurred? Finally, do we know if all users are impacted or only a particular segment?”

Here let’s imagine your interviewer tells you that the number of Feed sessions for all users has gone down 10% since yesterday. 

Only after you’ve clarified this information should you start exploring possible root-causes.

2. Explore possible root-causes: Interviewers want to see that you’re thinking of every possible problem which could cause the metric change you are investigating. 

In order to ensure you’re thinking comprehensively and communicating clearly, you should:

Create a MECE framework for possible root-causes.
Brainstorm potential root-causes to the problem within this framework.
Discuss the different root-causes identified with interviewer.

For our drop in engagement example, you could split your investigation between internal and external factors:

Internal factors: possible problems internal to Facebook that can explain the drop in sessions
External factors: possible problems external to Facebook that can explain the drop in sessions

Note that the framework above is MECE or Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. The root-cause of the problem has to be internal OR external, as there is no other option.

Once you’ve created your framework you need to brainstorm ideas and possible causes within each of the areas you identified. For example here you could populate your framework with the following points:

Internal factors:
Data accuracy (e.g. This metric change was measured incorrectly)
We broke the product (e.g. Someone in the organization made a change that broke the Newsfeed)
We made the product worse (e.g. The quality of content in the Feed has degraded)
other internal factors
External factors:
User habits (e.g. User changed habits overnight for some reason, like a protest)
Referrers (e.g. Google had an outage)
Competition (e.g. TikTok released a new feature that captured a portion of our normal Feed traffic)
other external factors

The interviewer will most likely stop you to talk about some of your proposed root-causes, which is perfectly normal. Listen carefully to what they say, as they will often provide clues that will point you in the right direction.

3. Conclude: Finally, you should conclude by summarizing your findings related to the initial question you were asked.

Let’s imagine that you discovered Facebook suffered an outage which caused the drop in sessions. In this case you might summarize by saying something like, “Based on what we’ve talked about, I would explain to the CEO that Newsfeed sessions dropped 10% since yesterday because of a major outage this morning. I would also make it clear that we came to this conclusion by ensuring it could not be any other cause, and double-checked that the duration of the outage aligns with the 10% drop.”

3. Example metrics questions with answers ↑

Now that you know how to approach metric questions, let's look at some full examples.

3.1 YouTube traffic went down 5% — how would you report this issue to the executive team?

This is a metric change question, so we’ll use the IGotAnOffer method described above.

Step one: Define the metric change

First we want to completely understand the question and define the metric, as “traffic” is a bit vague. 

Here are some questions that immediately come to mind and will help confirm our understanding:

What exactly do we mean by traffic here? Website visits, or plays on videos, or time spent watching? etc.
Is this impacting all user segments? Or maybe only a particular device type, or country, or browser? etc.
When did the dip start and how long did it last?

For the rest of this example let’s imagine the interviewer tells us that the average time spent watching per session is down 5% month-over-month worldwide on mobile only.

Step two: Explore possible root-causes

Now that we know the exact problem we can create a framework to identify the root-cause of the time spent watching per session decrease:

Internal factors: possible problems internal to YouTube that can explain the drop in average time spent watching per session
External factors: possible problems external to YouTube that can explain the drop in average time spent watching per session

Within this Internal / External framework, let’s brainstorm different root-causes that could drive down the average time spent watching per session:

Internal factors:
Data accuracy (e.g. We should confirm our reporting tool is working as expected)
Context (e.g. This could be an expected seasonal drop)
Access to the product (e.g. We might have had a major outage)
Product changes (e.g. We could have shipped some code that introduced a bug)
Product quality (e.g. Recent content might have been bad enough to drive away traffic)
External factors:
User habits (e.g. Video consumption is down across the industry)
Referrers (e.g. Facebook made a change to limit linking to YouTube videos)
Competition (e.g. Instagram TV released a new feature that captured our users)
Society (e.g. There’s less active users because of civil unrest in a country that typically drives a lot of traffic)

We can also dive deeper on some of the root causes. Here’s an example of how the conversation could go.

Data accuracy: Have we checked this dip compared to a similar metric — for example, time on page? Is there anything else indicating that our reporting tool might be broken?

Let’s imagine the interviewer confirms that we’re seeing a similar dip with time on page that leads us to believe the data is accurate. They also confirm that we’ve double-checked that our reporting is working as expected.

Context: Is there any history of a similar dip? We’re close to major holidays, perhaps that could lead to less product usage overall.

The interviewer lets us know the only time we’ve seen a drop of more than 1% this time of year was due to major outages, but we have had 100% uptime in the past few months. This information also addresses our next factor, as access to the product hasn’t been disrupted.

Product changes: Is it possible we shipped some code that introduced a bug? Or, did we release any significant feature changes?

Let’s imagine the interviewer says that the user interface for the video player was recently changed on mobile. We would then ask questions to explore this such as, “What exactly was changed in the UI and was any drop to be expected as a result?”

After discussing with the interviewer, we learn that the UI change involved making the “Send video to device” button two times larger, and reducing the “Full screen” button by half its original size. The interviewer also explains that the “Send video to device” button can be used to play a video that’s on your mobile phone on another device such as a Chromecast, Roku, SmartTV, etc.

This is interesting, but we need to investigate further. At this point, we could form a hypothesis and say something like, “Have we noticed a change in the frequency at which the ‘Send video to device’ and ‘Full screen’ buttons are being used on mobile? Maybe mobile users are having a harder time tapping the ‘Full screen’ button now that it’s smaller, and are tapping the ‘Send video to device’ button by accident because it’s too big? Tapping ‘Send video to device’ would end the session and therefore decrease the average time per session. And if the smaller ‘Full screen’ button is harder to tap, it might frustrate some users and lead them to end their session early.”

Let’s imagine that the interviewer confirms that this is likely one of the drivers of the decrease. Before making any final conclusion, we would continue exploring the remaining elements (i.e. product quality and external factors) to confirm that they aren’t also a driver of the change we are observing. Let’s imagine we quickly discuss this with our interviewer, and they confirm there’s nothing significant to report related to those remaining possible factors.

Step three: Discuss and conclude

Now that we’ve stepped through our framework, we would conclude by saying something like, “Based on what we’ve talked about, I would explain to the executive team that our time spent watching per session has dropped by 5% month-over-month on mobile because of a change in the video player UI, which has negatively affected the user experience. Mobile users are having a hard time tapping the new, smaller ‘Full screen’ button and are ending their session prematurely. They are also now more often tapping the larger ‘Send video to device’ button unintentionally which also ends their session early.”

Finally, we could enrich our answer by saying something such as, “We’ve also double-checked that no other drivers were causing this engagement dip. A good next step here would probably be to revert the UI changes, think through why we made these changes in the first place, and brainstorm how we can achieve the goals we were aiming for in a different way.”

6. How to prepare for product metrics questions

With a lot to cover, it’s best to take a systematic approach to make the most of your practice time. 

Below you’ll find links to free resources and four introductory steps that you can take to prepare for product metric questions.

6.1 Study the company you're applying to

Get acquainted with the company you’ve applied to. In many cases, the product questions you’ll be presented with will be based on real-life cases the company is facing. If you’re applying to a specific team, study up on their products, the user, etc.

Take the time to find out which products you’ll most likely be working with, based on the job description, and research them. Look up relevant press releases, product descriptions, product reviews, and other resources in order to discuss what’s most important to the role: the company’s product.

6.2 Learn by yourself

Learning by yourself is an essential first step. We recommend you make full use of the free prep resources on this blog and also watch some mock interviews on our product management YouTube channel. That way you can see what an excellent answer looks like. 

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

6.3 Practice with peers

If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate

They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company

On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up

For those reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert.

6.4 Practice with ex-interviewers

In our experience,  practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.

1. What is a product metrics interview question? ↑

Metric interview questions test if candidates can perform data analysis and select key metrics that matter most to the success of a product. 

Employers like Meta and Google use these questions to evaluate analytical thinking and communication skills. 

There are two types of metric questions: metric definition questions and metric change questions.

Metric definition questions focus on your ability to define metrics that provide clarity on the health of a product or feature. Here’s an example question: “What metrics would you use to determine success for Facebook Sponsored Posts?” 

There are many different metrics you could be tracking (e.g. impressions, clicks, return on ad spend, etc.) and your interviewer will want to hear you select the most important ones using a rigorous process.

Metric change questions test if you know what to do when a key product metric (e.g. traffic, revenue, engagement, etc.) is going up or down for no apparent reason. For example, “Facebook’s Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to your superior?” 

There are many different reasons why this decrease might be happening and your interviewer will want to see you take a bulletproof approach to find the root-cause of the issue.

2. How to answer metrics interview questions ↑

A common mistake candidates make when answering metric questions is to provide an unstructured answer. It’s very important for you to be prepared in demonstrating your analytical thinking and communication skills.

The key thing is to show data-driven decision-making. Mark, a former Meta and Google senior product manager, advises, “Be prepared to answer questions that require data interpretation and making data-driven decisions. Familiarize yourself with basic metrics for product success and have a few methodologies in mind for tackling growth, engagement, and scalability issues.""

Mark adds, ""You should be schooled on all the activation metrics - adoption, engagement, quality...etc. - there are dozens of metrics in there and you need to be solid on them all. Often I think people don't think enough about retention and especially at Meta, that's a huge metric and it's becoming more important at different companies too.""

Dessy, Head of Product at TikTok and a former Amazon senior product manager, shares, “Imagine a funnel in your mind by following that user journey, and have 1-2 metrics for each user step. This ensures you think through the metrics systematically and not randomly. Tie it back to overall company strategy and goals, link it back on how the product metrics will contribute to the overall company’s North Star metrics.”

In addition, Dessy says, “Always consider all sides, for example, in an eCommerce business, consider different metrics set for each type of users: Buyers (new buyers, active users, spent per user etc), Sellers (active sellers, active listings, etc.) and the Company itself (e.g. revenue, profitability). For ads, the different users would be: Users, Advertisers/Brands, Influencers, and the Company itself.  Also, walk through your entire thinking process with your interviewer; think out loud.”

Khalid, a former Facebook, Twitter, and DoorDash product manager, explains, ""All metrics have downsides, the aim isn’t to find a perfect metric, but a good enough metric that encapsulates the business/user goal while being aware of what its potential downside or error is.

""So, contextualize the 100% performance of a metric. Meaning, if you are building a payroll processing app, you can’t expect people to login daily, this isn’t the natural bar of success given that payroll processing is usually a biweekly habit, with some logins in between for handling some issues. Have an idea of where you 0 and 100% boundaries for a metric are to understand where you are progress wise.""

Khalid adds, ""Metrics have depth and correlation, differentiate between input and output metrics as for any one problem there is a spectrum of zooming in and out to pick the right metric. e.g if you’re running an ads team that focuses on improving the ads interfaces and your growl is increasing revenue, revenue is one metric, likely reported as a result metric to leadership, but there are many input metrics into that (e.g number of advertisers, ad spending per advertiser…etc) so to focus your time, 'advertiser growth' can be a better metric than just “revenue increase”, unless you are intentionally trying to cast a wide net in order to for example.""

In the next section, we’ll walk through two step-by-step approaches you can use to avoid that pitfall of an unstructured answer. We divide the approaches into two — one for metric definition questions and one for metric change questions.

2.1 Metric definition questions: GAME method

Metric definition question example

“What metrics would you use to determine success for Facebook Feed?”

Our recommendation is to use the GAME method to answer metric definition questions. Let’s walk through each of the four steps one by one:

Goals
Actions
Metrics
Evaluations

1. Goals: First, you should start by making sure you understand the product properly and agree with your interviewer on specific user and business objectives. 

Agreeing on the goals upfront is extremely important because what you measure will change entirely depending on what you’re trying to achieve with the product.

For instance, imagine your interviewer has asked you, “What metrics would you use to measure the success of Meta’s Facebook Feed?” The Feed is one of Facebook’s main features and it fulfills many objectives for the business. 

It’s a primary driver of user engagement, a strong revenue generator, and the main place where Facebook can test new personalization features. So, how do you determine what the most important objective is?

There’s no single right answer to this question but you could begin by saying, ""My understanding is that there are several use cases for the Feed including engaging users, generating ad revenue, and testing new personalization features. To stay healthy, Facebook needs strong user engagement, so I would assume that this is the primary business goal. Is that what you have in mind, too?""

2. Actions: Next, you should think about all the actions users can take in the product. Listing each action will help you focus on available metrics and avoid those that aren’t trackable.

The easiest way to do this is to think about what it really means for a user to be “engaged.” You should aim to list every relevant action (e.g. creating a post, viewing a post, commenting, liking, sharing, etc.). 

However, it’s also a good idea to avoid going into too much detail. For example, simply list “liking” as a category of action instead of “liking a friend’s post, liking a group’s post, liking an event, liking a comment, etc.”

Next, you need to prioritize your list of actions. Remember to use the goals you established in the previous step to explain your thinking. 

For instance, you might say something like, “There are a number of user actions which reflect engagement but I think the three most important ones are likely to be posting, commenting, and sharing.”

3. Metrics: Once you have a prioritized list of actions, it’s time to define associated metrics for each one. In this step it’s important that you define the metrics you will measure with precision.

Let’s imagine that in our previous step, after discussing with your interviewer, you prioritized the “comment” and “share” actions. Talking about “comments” and “shares” isn’t sufficient as there are many different ways in which you can track these actions.

In order to measure engagement based on these actions, here are some metrics that would make sense to track:

""Comment"" metrics
Comments per thousand sessions
Comments per thousand posts seen
Comments per thousand posts clicked
""Share"" metrics
Shares per thousand sessions
Shares per thousand posts seen
Shares per thousand posts clicked

4. Evaluations: After defining metrics, you should conclude the discussion by answering the initial question with the metrics you recommend. Finally, evaluate the metrics you have selected by highlighting trade-offs and limitations.

For the Facebook Feed example, you could summarize by saying something like, “So, in order to increase Feed engagement, I would first look at comments and shares per thousand sessions. These metrics would give us an idea of meaningful engagement for the average user.”

The last key step is to show that you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your recommended metrics.

So you could wrap up your answer by saying something like:

“We should keep in mind that not all commenting and sharing is positive. Perhaps we should monitor the sentiment of these actions to make sure we're creating a positive experience overall. Also, commenting and sharing represent deep engagement. If we are interested in shallower engagement we might need to consider other metrics (e.g. number of sessions per user per day, number of likes per user, etc.) to measure engagement for users who don't comment or share but still use the product frequently.”

2.2 Metric change questions: IGotAnOffer method

Metric change question example

“Facebook Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to the your superior?”

We developed the IGotAnOffer method below to help you give a clear and thorough answer to metric change questions. Let’s walk through each of the three steps one by one:

Define the metric change.
Explore possible root-causes of the change.
Conclude.

1. Define the metric change: Many candidates skip this step and start listing ideas in an unstructured way. This is a big red flag for interviewers. Before starting to answer the question you need to define the metric change in detail. This often entails asking for three pieces of information:

The exact definition of the metric we’re talking about
The time period over which the metric has changed
The characteristics of the user segment impacted by the change (e.g. device type, country, etc.)

Let’s imagine your interviewer asks, “Facebook Feed engagement is down 10%. How would you report this issue to the CEO?” 

To clarify your understanding, you might then ask something like, “What exactly do we mean by engagement here? Is that a direct measurement like number of sessions, or a combination of more detailed metrics (e.g. likes + comments + shares per user, etc.)? And over what time period has that change occurred? Finally, do we know if all users are impacted or only a particular segment?”

Here let’s imagine your interviewer tells you that the number of Feed sessions for all users has gone down 10% since yesterday. 

Only after you’ve clarified this information should you start exploring possible root-causes.

2. Explore possible root-causes: Interviewers want to see that you’re thinking of every possible problem which could cause the metric change you are investigating. 

In order to ensure you’re thinking comprehensively and communicating clearly, you should:

Create a MECE framework for possible root-causes.
Brainstorm potential root-causes to the problem within this framework.
Discuss the different root-causes identified with interviewer.

For our drop in engagement example, you could split your investigation between internal and external factors:

Internal factors: possible problems internal to Facebook that can explain the drop in sessions
External factors: possible problems external to Facebook that can explain the drop in sessions

Note that the framework above is MECE or Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. The root-cause of the problem has to be internal OR external, as there is no other option.

Once you’ve created your framework you need to brainstorm ideas and possible causes within each of the areas you identified. For example here you could populate your framework with the following points:

Internal factors:
Data accuracy (e.g. This metric change was measured incorrectly)
We broke the product (e.g. Someone in the organization made a change that broke the Newsfeed)
We made the product worse (e.g. The quality of content in the Feed has degraded)
other internal factors
External factors:
User habits (e.g. User changed habits overnight for some reason, like a protest)
Referrers (e.g. Google had an outage)
Competition (e.g. TikTok released a new feature that captured a portion of our normal Feed traffic)
other external factors

The interviewer will most likely stop you to talk about some of your proposed root-causes, which is perfectly normal. Listen carefully to what they say, as they will often provide clues that will point you in the right direction.

3. Conclude: Finally, you should conclude by summarizing your findings related to the initial question you were asked.

Let’s imagine that you discovered Facebook suffered an outage which caused the drop in sessions. In this case you might summarize by saying something like, “Based on what we’ve talked about, I would explain to the CEO that Newsfeed sessions dropped 10% since yesterday because of a major outage this morning. I would also make it clear that we came to this conclusion by ensuring it could not be any other cause, and double-checked that the duration of the outage aligns with the 10% drop.”

3. Example metrics questions with answers ↑

Now that you know how to approach metric questions, let's look at some full examples.

3.1 YouTube traffic went down 5% — how would you report this issue to the executive team?

This is a metric change question, so we’ll use the IGotAnOffer method described above.

Step one: Define the metric change

First we want to completely understand the question and define the metric, as “traffic” is a bit vague. 

Here are some questions that immediately come to mind and will help confirm our understanding:

What exactly do we mean by traffic here? Website visits, or plays on videos, or time spent watching? etc.
Is this impacting all user segments? Or maybe only a particular device type, or country, or browser? etc.
When did the dip start and how long did it last?

For the rest of this example let’s imagine the interviewer tells us that the average time spent watching per session is down 5% month-over-month worldwide on mobile only.

Step two: Explore possible root-causes

Now that we know the exact problem we can create a framework to identify the root-cause of the time spent watching per session decrease:

Internal factors: possible problems internal to YouTube that can explain the drop in average time spent watching per session
External factors: possible problems external to YouTube that can explain the drop in average time spent watching per session

Within this Internal / External framework, let’s brainstorm different root-causes that could drive down the average time spent watching per session:

Internal factors:
Data accuracy (e.g. We should confirm our reporting tool is working as expected)
Context (e.g. This could be an expected seasonal drop)
Access to the product (e.g. We might have had a major outage)
Product changes (e.g. We could have shipped some code that introduced a bug)
Product quality (e.g. Recent content might have been bad enough to drive away traffic)
External factors:
User habits (e.g. Video consumption is down across the industry)
Referrers (e.g. Facebook made a change to limit linking to YouTube videos)
Competition (e.g. Instagram TV released a new feature that captured our users)
Society (e.g. There’s less active users because of civil unrest in a country that typically drives a lot of traffic)

We can also dive deeper on some of the root causes. Here’s an example of how the conversation could go.

Data accuracy: Have we checked this dip compared to a similar metric — for example, time on page? Is there anything else indicating that our reporting tool might be broken?

Let’s imagine the interviewer confirms that we’re seeing a similar dip with time on page that leads us to believe the data is accurate. They also confirm that we’ve double-checked that our reporting is working as expected.

Context: Is there any history of a similar dip? We’re close to major holidays, perhaps that could lead to less product usage overall.

The interviewer lets us know the only time we’ve seen a drop of more than 1% this time of year was due to major outages, but we have had 100% uptime in the past few months. This information also addresses our next factor, as access to the product hasn’t been disrupted.

Product changes: Is it possible we shipped some code that introduced a bug? Or, did we release any significant feature changes?

Let’s imagine the interviewer says that the user interface for the video player was recently changed on mobile. We would then ask questions to explore this such as, “What exactly was changed in the UI and was any drop to be expected as a result?”

After discussing with the interviewer, we learn that the UI change involved making the “Send video to device” button two times larger, and reducing the “Full screen” button by half its original size. The interviewer also explains that the “Send video to device” button can be used to play a video that’s on your mobile phone on another device such as a Chromecast, Roku, SmartTV, etc.

This is interesting, but we need to investigate further. At this point, we could form a hypothesis and say something like, “Have we noticed a change in the frequency at which the ‘Send video to device’ and ‘Full screen’ buttons are being used on mobile? Maybe mobile users are having a harder time tapping the ‘Full screen’ button now that it’s smaller, and are tapping the ‘Send video to device’ button by accident because it’s too big? Tapping ‘Send video to device’ would end the session and therefore decrease the average time per session. And if the smaller ‘Full screen’ button is harder to tap, it might frustrate some users and lead them to end their session early.”

Let’s imagine that the interviewer confirms that this is likely one of the drivers of the decrease. Before making any final conclusion, we would continue exploring the remaining elements (i.e. product quality and external factors) to confirm that they aren’t also a driver of the change we are observing. Let’s imagine we quickly discuss this with our interviewer, and they confirm there’s nothing significant to report related to those remaining possible factors.

Step three: Discuss and conclude

Now that we’ve stepped through our framework, we would conclude by saying something like, “Based on what we’ve talked about, I would explain to the executive team that our time spent watching per session has dropped by 5% month-over-month on mobile because of a change in the video player UI, which has negatively affected the user experience. Mobile users are having a hard time tapping the new, smaller ‘Full screen’ button and are ending their session prematurely. They are also now more often tapping the larger ‘Send video to device’ button unintentionally which also ends their session early.”

Finally, we could enrich our answer by saying something such as, “We’ve also double-checked that no other drivers were causing this engagement dip. A good next step here would probably be to revert the UI changes, think through why we made these changes in the first place, and brainstorm how we can achieve the goals we were aiming for in a different way.”

6. How to prepare for product metrics questions

With a lot to cover, it’s best to take a systematic approach to make the most of your practice time. 

Below you’ll find links to free resources and four introductory steps that you can take to prepare for product metric questions.

6.1 Study the company you're applying to

Get acquainted with the company you’ve applied to. In many cases, the product questions you’ll be presented with will be based on real-life cases the company is facing. If you’re applying to a specific team, study up on their products, the user, etc.

Take the time to find out which products you’ll most likely be working with, based on the job description, and research them. Look up relevant press releases, product descriptions, product reviews, and other resources in order to discuss what’s most important to the role: the company’s product.

6.2 Learn by yourself

Learning by yourself is an essential first step. We recommend you make full use of the free prep resources on this blog and also watch some mock interviews on our product management YouTube channel. That way you can see what an excellent answer looks like. 

Once you’re in command of the subject matter, you’ll want to practice answering questions. But by yourself, you can’t simulate thinking on your feet or the pressure of performing in front of a stranger. Plus, there are no unexpected follow-up questions and no feedback.

That’s why many candidates try to practice with friends or peers.

6.3 Practice with peers

If you have friends or peers who can do mock interviews with you, that's an option worth trying. It’s free, but be warned, you may come up against the following problems:

It’s hard to know if the feedback you get is accurate

They’re unlikely to have insider knowledge of interviews at your target company

On peer platforms, people often waste your time by not showing up

For those reasons, many candidates skip peer mock interviews and go straight to mock interviews with an expert.

6.4 Practice with ex-interviewers

In our experience,  practicing real interviews with experts who can give you company-specific feedback makes a huge difference.
